[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d0be032e-c23d-48e5-8fbc-f7d5f2388fce/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/armory-docs/deploys)

# Overview

This is the repo for Armory documentation (https://docs.armory.io). We welcome contributions from people outside of Armory.

The latest version of the docs website is the `master` branch. Previous releases point to branches that start with `release-`.

## Prerequisites

The site is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which generates a preview build for every pull request. Install the following if you want to compile and run the project locally. Make sure to install the Hugo extended version specified by the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable in the [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml#L14) file.

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- A container runtime, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).


## Cloning the project

People who are not part of the Armory organization need to create a fork of this repo. See the GitHub.com help [docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-forks) for how to fork a repo.

Clone your forked repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<github-username>/docs.git
```

Armory docs uses the [Docsy Hugo theme](https://github.com/google/docsy#readme) theme as a submodule. You have to update the submodule if you want to build locally. Even if you plan to run the website in a container, we strongly recommend pulling in the submodule and other development dependencies by running the following:

```bash
cd docs
yarn # install Yarn depend
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Set this docs repo as the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/armory/docs.git
```

Confirm your origin and upstream repositories:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Output is similar to:

```bash
origin	git@github.com:<github-username>/docs.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:<github-username>/docs.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/armory/docs.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/armory/docs.git (push)
```

## Update your local repository

Make sure your local repository is current before you start making changes. Fetch commits from your fork's `origin/master` and `spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io`'s `upstream/master`:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git fetch upstream
   ```

## Create a working branch

Make sure you are in your `master` branch before you create your working
branch. You can use `git branch` to see which branch you are in.

```bash
git branch
```

The output lists your local branches. There is an `*` next to the branch you are in.

```bash
working-branch-1
working-branch-2
* master
```

If you are not in `master`, execute `git checkout master` to go to your `master` branch. See the [Understanding history: What is a branch?](https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual#what-is-a-branch) section of the _Git User Manual_ for more information.

Create a new working branch based on `upstream/master`.

```bash
git checkout -b <your-working-branch> upstream/master
```

Since `git` tracks changes to `upstream\master`, you don't need to rebase your fork before you create a working branch.

Content is in `content/en/docs`. Make your changes to the desired file.

Use the `git status` command at any time to see what files you've changed.

## Running the website locally

### Using a container

To build the site in a container, run the following to build the container image and run it:

```
make container-image
make container-serve
```

Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.

### Using Hugo

To build and test the site locally, run:

```bash
make serve
```

This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.

### Troubleshooting macOS for too many open files

If you run `make serve` on macOS and receive the following error:

```
ERROR 2020/08/01 19:09:18 Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:1313: socket: too many open files
make: *** [serve] Error 1
```

Try checking the current limit for open files:

`launchctl limit maxfiles`

Then run the following commands (adapted from https://gist.github.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c):

```

sudo mv limit.maxfiles.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo mv limit.maxproc.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons

sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist

sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
```

This works for Catalina as well as Mojave macOS.


## Commit your changes

Check which files you need to commit:

```bash
git status
```

Output is similar to:

```bash
On branch <your-working-branch>
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

modified:   content/en/docs/spinnaker/armory-halyard.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Create a commit:

```bash
git commit -a -m "<your-commit-subject>" -m "<your-commit-description>"
```

- `-a`: Commit all staged changes.
- `-m`: Use the given `<your-commit-subject>` as the commit message. If multiple `-m` options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs.

Your commit messages must be 50 characters or less. Do not use any [GitHub
Keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) in your commit message. You can add those to the pull request description later.

Push your working branch and its new commit to your remote fork:

```bash
git push origin <your-working-branch>
```

You can commit and push many times before you create your PR.

## Create your pull request

See the GitHub [docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for how to create a pull request from a fork.

## Monitoring

The Armory documentation uses New Relic to monitor the website status and other metrics.
