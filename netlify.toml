# cdaas redirects
# The Netlify redirects engine will process the first matching rule it finds, reading from top to bottom. The redirect engine processes the first matching rule it finds, so more specific rules should be listed before more general ones

# https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/
# status = 301 (default); permanent redirect code. Tells the client that the address for this resource has permanently changed, and any indexes using the old address should start using the new one. The URL in the browser address bar will display the new address.
