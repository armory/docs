## Overview of the Kubernetes Custom Resource Status Check Plugin

The Kubernetes Custom Resource Status Check Plugin checks for the status of a Custom Resource deployment by comparing the values set in the properties and
updating the Deploy (Manifest) stage pipeline status. The plugin supports two ways to check for a status in your Custom Resource while deploying using
Armory CD:

1. Kubernetes conditions
2. Any other custom field(s)

The plugin also checks that:

* All the associated replicas have been updated to the latest version you specified, meaning any updates you requested are complete.
* All the replicas associated with the Deployment are available.
* No old replicas for the Deployment are running.

These replica checks are enabled by default and do not require additional configuration.

## Version Compatibility

| Armory CD (Spinnaker) Version | Plugin Version |
|:-------|:-------------------|
| 2.28.x (1.28.x) | 2.0.x |
| 2.27.x (1.27.x) | 1.0.0 |

## Configuration

Put the plugin configuration in the `spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles.clouddriver` section of your Operator `spinnakerservice.yml`:

```yaml
... (omitted for brevity)
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      clouddriver:
        spinnaker:
          extensibility:
            plugins:
              Armory.K8sCustomResourceStatus:
                enabled: true
                version: <version>
              repositories:
                pluginRepository:
                  url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/pluginRepository/master/repositories.json
```

* `version`: The plugin version that corresponds to your Armory CD version.

## Usage

### Supported Statuses

The plugin uses the following statuses:

* **Stable Deployment**

   By default, you do not need to set the expected `Stable` values in your Custom Resource. The plugin sets the status as **Stable** if you do not set the Stable properties. This means that you can only check for negative values. If you manually set the possible Stable values in the properties, the plugin knows that you explicitly want to check for a status.

* **Failed Deployment**

   By default, the plugin sets the default status to `Stable`. If you want to check for certain failed statuses, you can set them in the properties. When a deployment fails, the Deploy Manifest stage will stop and mark the deployment as Failed.

* **Paused Deployment**

   When a deployment is `Paused`, the stage finishes and the message is rendered in yellow.

* **Unavailable Deployment**

   When a deployment is **Unavailable**, the stage continues to query the status and wait for the deployment to become stable.

### Properties

All supported properties with some example values:

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    plugins:
      Armory.K8sCustomResourceStatus:
        enabled: true
        config:
          kind:
            my-kind: # The name of your Custom Resource
              stable:
                conditions:
                  - message:
                    reason:
                    status:
                    type:
                  - status:
                    type:
                fields:
                  - field1: value1
                    field2: value2
                  - item2: valueX
          status:
            stable:
              markAsUnavailableUntilStable: false # optional
              failIfNoMatch: false # optional
              conditions:
                - message:
                  reason:
                  status:
                  type:
                - status:
                  type:
              fields:
                - field1: value1
                - field2: value2
            failed:
              conditions:
                - message:
                  reason:
                  status:
                  type:
                - status:
                  type:
              fields:
                - field1: value1
                - field2: value2
            paused:
              conditions:
                - message:
                  reason:
                  status:
                  type:
                - status:
                  type:
              fields:
                - field1: value1
                - field2: value2
            unavailable:
              conditions:
                - message:
                  reason:
                  status:
                  type:
                - status:
                  type:
              fields:
                - field1: value1
                - field2: value2
{{< /prism >}}

* `markAsUnavailableUntilStable`: (Optional) Only used under `stable` properties. If the plugin doesn't find any of the fields declared under `stable`, it marks the deployment as unavailable and waits for the deployment to become stable. The status changes to stable when the plugin finds any of the fields in the properties.
* `failIfNoMatch`: (Optional) Only used under `stable` properties. In this example, if the plugin doesn't find any of the fields, it marks the deployment as failed.

### Considerations

All values below `config` are optional. You have the flexibility to check for multiple combinations of kinds, statuses, and values.

Under `config`, you can split the statuses per Custom Resource kind or set statuses that apply to all Custom Resources deployed, except the ones you declare by kind.

* If you set any statuses under a specific `kind`, whenever you deploy that `kind`, the plugin checks for those statuses in isolation and not any other values from other kinds or the general list under `status`.
* If you set the statuses under the `status` field, the statuses apply to any Custom Resource you deploy, except any declared kinds in the properties.

Each field under `conditions` is optional. But any condition field you set in the properties must match your manifest conditions in order for the plugin to update the status in your pipeline correctly.

* If you add multiple list items under `conditions`, the plugin updates the status as soon as it finds a match and stops checking any other list items. The plugin does not evaluate any further.
* Each list item under `fields` is a map. Every field per map has to match your expected values in the manifest. If the first map of fields do not match, the plugin proceeds to check the next list item.

### Custom field syntax

Values under `fields` have a custom syntax to access the value from the manifest.

Accepted field formats:

* Simple: `field`
* Nested: `field1.field2.field3`
* Indexed: `field[index]`
* Mapped: `field(key)`
* Combined: `field1.field2[index].field3(key)`

For example, if you want to access the field `ready` with the value `True`:

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}
apiVersion: example.com
kind: Foo
metadata:
  generation: 12
  name: bar
spec:
  replicas: 1
status:
  observedGeneration: 12
  values:
    - ready: "True"
{{< /prism >}}

The syntax is:

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}ml
config:
  kind:
    status:
      available:
        fields:
          - status.values.[0].ready: "True"
{{< /prism >}}

## Examples

### Example 1: Custom Resource following Kubernetes API guidelines with conditions

`kubectl get foo -o yaml`

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}
apiVersion: example.com
kind: Foo
metadata:
  generation: 12
  name: bar
spec:
  replicas: 1
status:
  observedGeneration: 12
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2020-03-25T21:20:38Z"
      lastUpdateTime: "2020-03-25T21:20:38Z"
      message: Resource is reconciling
      reason: Reconciling
      status: "True"
      type: Reconciling
    - lastTransitionTime: "2020-03-25T21:20:27Z"
      lastUpdateTime: "2020-03-25T21:20:39Z"
      status: "False"
      type: Stalled
{{< /prism>}}

First map this custom resource's status values to the plugin configuration. The plugin updates the status if the values from the config match the values from your custom resource.

#### Example 1.1: Config per kind

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    plugins:
      Armory.K8sCustomResourceStatus:
        enabled: true
        config:
          kind:
            Foo: # Foo is the name of your Custom Resource kind
              stable:
                conditions:
                  - message: Resource is Ready
                    reason: ResourceReady
                    status: True
                    type: Ready
                  - status: Pod is stable
                    type: Stable
              failed:
                conditions:
                  - message: Deployment exceeded its progress deadline
                    reason: ProgressDeadlineExceeded
                    status: "False"
                    type: Progressing
              paused:
                conditions:
                  - message: Deployment paused
                    reason: DeploymentPaused
                    status: "True"
                    type: Progressing
              unavailable:
                conditions:
                  - message: Resource is reconciling
                    reason: Reconciling
                    status: "True"
                    type: Reconciling
{{< /prism >}}

These properties are only for `Foo` kind. Every time you deploy `Foo`, the plugin compares the resource status values against these properties. In this case, the plugin marks the deployment as unavailable since it matches your custom resource.

#### Example 1.2: Config for all Custom Resources

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    plugins:
      Armory.K8sCustomResourceStatus:
        enabled: true
        config:
          status:
            stable:
              conditions:
                - message: Resource is Ready
                  reason: ResourceReady
                  status: True
                  type: Ready
                - status: Pod is stable
                  type: Stable
            failed:
              conditions:
                - message: Deployment exceeded its progress deadline
                  reason: ProgressDeadlineExceeded
                  status: "False"
                  type: Progressing
            paused:
              conditions:
                - message: Deployment paused
                  reason: DeploymentPaused
                  status: "True"
                  type: Progressing
            unavailable:
              conditions:
                - message: Resource is reconciling
                  reason: Reconciling
                  status: "True"
                  type: Reconciling
{{< /prism >}}

These properties apply to all custom resource kinds you deploy. If you deploy different kinds with different statuses, you should declare per kind like in `Example 1.1`. In this case, the plugin marks the deployment as unavailable since that matches your custom resource.

### Example 2: Custom Resource with Non-Standard status fields

`kubectl get foo -o yaml`

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}
apiVersion: example.com
kind: Foo
metadata:
  generation: 12
  name: bar
spec:
  replicas: 1
status:
  status: Ready
  message: API is ready
  collisionCount: 0
{{< /prism >}}

First map this custom resource's status value to the plugin configuration. The plugin updates the status if the values from the config match the values from your custom resource.

#### Example 2.1: Config per kind

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    plugins:
      Armory.K8sCustomResourceStatus:
        enabled: true
        config:
          kind:
            Foo: # The name of your Custom Resource
              stable:
                fields:
                  - status.status: Ready
                    status.message: API is ready
                    status.collisionCount: 0
              failed:
                fields:
                  - status.ready: False
                    status.collisionCount: 1
              paused:
                fields:
                  - status.paused: True
                    status.collisionCount: 0
              unavailable:
                fields:
                  - status.available: False
                    status.collisionCount: 0
{{< /prism >}}

These properties are only for `Foo` kind. Every time you deploy `Foo`, it compares the resource status values against these properties. In this case, the plugin marks the deployment as ready since that matches your custom resource.

#### Example 2.2: Config for all Custom Resources

{{< prism lang="yaml" >}}
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    plugins:
      Armory.K8sCustomResourceStatus:
        enabled: true
        config:
          status:
            stable:
              fields:
                - status.status: Ready
                  status.message: API is ready
                  status.collisionCount: 0
            failed:
              fields:
                - status.ready: False
                  status.collisionCount: 1
            paused:
              fields:
                - status.paused: True
                  status.collisionCount: 0
            unavailable:
              fields:
                - status.available: False
                  status.collisionCount: 0
{{< /prism >}}

These properties apply to all custom resource kinds you deploy. If you deploy different kinds with different statuses, you should declare per kind like in `Example 2.1`. In this case, the plugin marks the deployment as ready since that
matches your custom resource.
