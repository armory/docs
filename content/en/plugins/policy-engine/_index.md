## Overview of the Armory Policy Engine

The [Armory Policy Engine](https://www.armory.io/products/policy-engine/) is a proprietary feature for Armory Continuous Deployment and open source Spinnaker. It is designed to enable more complete control of your software delivery process by providing you with the hooks necessary to make assertions about the structure and behavior of pipelines and processes in your environment. The Policy Engine uses the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) and input style documents to perform validations on the following:

* **Save time validation** - Validate pipelines as they're created or modified. Tasks with no policies are not validated.
* **Runtime validation** - Validate deployments as a pipeline is executing. Tasks with no policies are not validated.
* **Entitlements using API Authorization** - Enforce restrictions on who can perform certain actions. Note that if you enable policies for API authorization, you must configure who can make API calls or else the API service (Gate) rejects all API calls.

>If no policies are configured for these policy checks, all actions are allowed.

At a high level, adding policies for the Policy Engine to use is a two-step process:

1. Create the policies and save them to a `.rego` file.
2. Add the policies to the OPA server with a ConfigMap or API request.

These policies are evaluated against the packages that Armory Continuous Deployment sends between its services. For a list of packages that you can write policies against, see {{< linkWithTitle "plugins/policy-engine/use/packages/_index.md" >}}. 

Enabling the Policy Engine consists of the following steps:

1. [Deploy an OPA server](#deploy-an-opa-server)
1. [Enable the Policy Engine plugin](#enable-the-policy-engine-plugin)

## Compatibility

{{< include "plugins/policy-engine/plugin-compat-matrix.md" >}}

**OPA requirements**

The Policy Engine requires an Open Policy Agent server. This can be deployed in the same cluster as Armory Continuous Deployment or in an external cluster.

The following table lists the requirements:

| Requirement | Version         | Note                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPA Server  | 0.12.x or later | Specifically, the v1 API must be available. When you specify the OPA server URL in the Armory Continuous Deployment configs, include `v1` in the URL: `http://<your-opa-server>:<port>/v1`. |

**Supported validations**

| Validation           | Armory Continuous Deployment Version | Note                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Save time validation | All supported versions    | If no policies are set, you cannot save any pipelines until you set any policy or turn off save time validation. |
| Runtime validation   | All supported versions    | If no policies are set, no policy enforcement occurs and pipelines run as they do normally.                      |

## {{% heading "prereq" %}}

* The Policy Engine requires an [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) server, version 0.12.x or later. You can use the example on this page to deploy a server in the same Kubernetes cluster as Armory Continuous Deployment. Alternately, see the OPA documentation for information about how to [deploy an OPA server](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/deployments/). Specifically, the OPA v1 API must be available.
* You have identified the Policy Engine plugin that is compatible with your version of Armory Continuous Deployment or Spinnaker. See the [Supported versions](#supported-versions) section.
* If you are using Spinnaker, you are familiar with [installing and using plugins](https://spinnaker.io/docs/guides/user/plugins-users/) in Spinnaker.

## Deploy an OPA server

The Policy Engine supports the following OPA server deployments:

* An OPA server deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster as an Armory CD or Spinnaker deployment. The [Use ConfigMaps for Open Policy Agent policies](#use-configmaps-for-open-policy-agent-policies) section contains a ConfigMap you can use.
* An OPA cluster that is **not** in the same Kubernetes cluster as an Armory CD or Spinnaker deployment. See the [OPA documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) for more information about installing an OPA server in a separate cluster.

### Use ConfigMaps for Open Policy Agent policies

If you want to use ConfigMaps for OPA policies, you can use the following manifest as a starting point. This example manifest deploys an OPA server and applies the configuration for things like RoleBinding and a static DNS. When using the example, keep the following guidelines in mind:

* The manifest does not configure any authorization requirements for the OPA server it deploys. This means that anyone can add a policy.
* The manifest deploys the OPA server to a namespace called `opa`.
* The OPA server uses `"--require-policy-label=true"`. This configures the OPA server to look for a specific label so that it does not check all ConfigMaps for new policies. For information about how to apply the relevant label to your policy ConfigMaps, see [Add the policy to your OPA server]({{< ref "/plugins/policy-engine/use#step-2-add-the-policy-to-your-opa-server" >}}).

## Install the Policy Engine plugin

You have the following options for installing the Policy Engine plugin:

* **Armory CD**: Armory Operator
* **Spinnaker**: Spinnaker Operator, Local Config, or Halyard

{{% alert color="warning" title="A note about installing plugins in Spinnaker" %}}
When Halyard adds a plugin to a Spinnaker installation, it adds the plugin repository information to all services, not just the ones the plugin is for. This means that when you restart Spinnaker, each service restarts, downloads the plugin, and checks if an extension exists for that service. Each service restarting is not ideal for large Spinnaker installations due to service restart times. Clouddriver can take an hour or more to restart if you have many accounts configured.

The Policy Engine plugin extends Orca, Gate, Front50, Clouddriver, and Deck. To avoid every Spinnaker service restarting and downloading the plugin, do not add the plugin using Halyard. Instead, follow the **Local Config** installation method, in which you configure the plugin in each extended service’s local profile.

The Spinnaker Operator and Armory Operator add configuration only to extended services.

{{% tab header="**Install Method**:" disabled=true /%}}

{{% tab header="Spinnaker Operator" %}}

You can install the Policy Engine plugin using the Spinnaker Operator and the sample manifest, which uses Kustomize and is in the [spinnaker-kustomize-patches repository](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-kustomize-patches/tree/master/armory/features/policy-engine).

{{< github repo="armory/spinnaker-kustomize-patches" file="armory/features/policy-engine/kustomization.yml" lang="yaml" options="" >}}
</details><br />

**Note: The sample manifest is for the Armory Operator and Armory CD. When using the Spinnaker Operator and Spinnaker, you must replace the `apiVersion` value "spinnaker.armory.io/" with "spinnaker.io/". For example:**
  * **Armory Operator: `apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2`**
  * **Spinnaker Operator: `apiVersion: spinnaker.io/v1alpha2`**

This patch uses [YAML anchors](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_advanced_syntax.html#yaml-anchors-and-aliases-sharing-variable-values) to ensure that plugin versions are set correctly throughout Spinnaker's config. In the `gate.spinnaker.extensibility.deck-proxy.plugins.Armory.PolicyEngine.version` entry, make sure to replace the version number listed after `&version` with the version of the plugin you want to use. Refer to the [supported versions](#supported-versions) section to determine the correct plugin version for your installation.

Apply the manifest using `kubectl`.

{{% tab header="Local Config" %}}

The Policy Engine plugin extends Orca, Gate, Front50, Clouddriver, and Deck. You should create or update the extended service's local profile in the same directory as the other Halyard configuration files. This is usually `~/.hal/default/profiles` on the machine where Halyard is running.

1. Add the following to `gate-local.yml`, `orca-local.yml`, `front50-local.yml`, and `clouddriver.yml`:

   ```yaml
   armory:
      policyEngine:
         failOpen: false
         opa:
            # Replace with the actual URL to your Open Policy Agent deployment
            baseUrl: http://localhost:8181/v1/data
            # Optional. The number of seconds that the Policy Engine will wait for a response from the OPA server. Default is 10 seconds if omitted.
            # timeoutSeconds: <integer>
    spinnaker:
       extensibility:
          plugins:
             Armory.PolicyEngine:
                enabled: true
             policyEngine:
                url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/pluginRepository/master/repositories.json
    ```

1. Save your files and apply your changes by running `hal deploy apply`.
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="Halyard" %}}

1. Add the plugins repository

   ```bash
   hal plugins repository add policyEngine \
    --url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/pluginRepository/master/repositories.json
   ```

   This creates the following entry in your `.hal/config`:

   ```yaml
   repositories:
      policyEngine:
         enabled: true
         url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/pluginRepository/master/repositories.json
   ```

1. Add the plugin
   
   Be sure to replace `<version>` with the version that's compatible with your Spinnaker instance.
   ```bash
   hal plugins add Armory.PolicyEngine --version=<version> --enabled=true
   ```

   If you specified version 0.2.2, Halyard creates the following entry in your `.hal/config` file: 
   ```yaml
   spinnaker:
      extensibility:
         plugins:
            Armory.PolicyEngine:
               id: Armory.PolicyEngine
               enabled: true
               version: 0.2.2
   ```

1. Apply the changes by executing `hal deploy apply`. 
{{% /tab %}}

#### Timeout settings

You can configure the amount of time that the Policy Engine waits for a response from your OPA server. If you have network or latency issues, increasing the timeout can make Policy Engine more resilient. Use `spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles.spinnaker.armory.policyEngine.opa.timeoutSeconds` to set the timeout in seconds. The default timeout is 10 seconds if you omit the config.
