## Release notes

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

## 2.30

### Permissions check for a commit

`userWritePermissionsCheckEnabled`

This new feature, when enabled, verifies if the author of a commit that changed app parameters has sufficient WRITE permission for that app. Users can specify a list of authors whose permissions are not valid. This optionâ€™s purpose is to skip permissions checks for bots and tools.

This feature is **disabled by default**. To enable this feature, see [Permissions check for a commit]({{< ref "plugins/pipelines-as-code/install/configure#permissions-check-for-a-commit" >}}).

### Known issue

#### `multipleBranchesEnabled: false` not working as expected

**Armory CD 2.30.3, 2.30.4, 2.30.5**

When `multipleBranchesEnabled: false`, you may notice that the configuration `multipleBranchesEnabled` is never set to  even though it is set to false under the Dinghy profiles settings. This may cause `dinghyfile` changes on the master/main branch to be pushed unexpectedly. 

You can read more about this issue in the [KB article](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010817).


## 2.27

### Multi-branch enhancement

Now you can configure Pipelines-as-Code to pull Dinghy files from multiple branches in the same repo. Cut out the tedious task of managing multiple repos; have a single repo for Spinnaker application pipelines. See [Multiple branches]({{< ref "plugins/pipelines-as-code/install/configure#multiple-branches" >}}) for how to enable and configure this feature.

## 2.24

### MySQL as backing store

Pipelines-as-Code now supports using MySQL as the backing store, which can provide more durability and scalability than Redis. This feature is currently in early access.

For information about how to configure the backing store for Pipelines-as-Code, see [Configuring SQL]({{< ref "plugins/pipelines-as-code/install/configure#configuring-redis" >}}).

## 2.21

### GitHub pull request validation

Pipelines-as-Code now supports pull request (PR) validation for GitHub. When a PR is submitted, you can ensure that the `dinghyfile` is valid by enabling this feature.

For more information, see [Pull Request Validation]({{< ref "plugins/pipelines-as-code/install/configure#pull-request-validations" >}}).

## Known issues

### Failed to load configuration

If Pipelines-as-Code crashes on start up and you encounter an error similar to:

```bash
time="2020-03-06T22:35:54Z"
level=fatal
msg="failed to load configuration: 1 error(s) decoding:\n\n* 'Logging.Level' expected type 'string', got unconvertible type 'map[string]interface {}'"
```

You probably configured global logging levels with `spinnaker-local.yml`. The workaround is to override Dinghy's logging levels:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=9-10" >}}
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      dinghy:
        Logging:
          Level: INFO
{{< /highlight >}}
