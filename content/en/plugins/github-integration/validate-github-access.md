## Validate GitHub access

This feature validates GitHub access based on configuration assigned to a GitHub App account, providing an additional **access control** validation layer of a GitHub App account in Spinnaker against the defined GitHub Teams in the repository.

Using the `impersonateGitHubTeam` feature, you can validate and enforce GitHub App account access to repositories based on the GitHub team's assigned configuration.

### How this feature works

Before performing any action in a pipeline stage, the plugin validates that the GitHub teams configured using the `impersonateGitHubTeam` feature are assigned with one of the following roles in GitHub:

- `Admin`: Full access to the repository
- `Write`: Read and write access to the repository
- `Maintain`: Read and write access to the repository, including managing issues and pull requests

If the GitHub team does not have appropriate access to the repository, the pipeline stage fails with an error message.

user ->> gate: Start execution for pipeline (includes plugin stage)
gate ->> orca: Submit execution for pipeline (includes plugin stage)
orca ->> igor: Submit the task operations of plugin stage
igor ->> fiat: Check hasPermissions
alt Unauthorized
	fiat ->> igor: hasPermissions=false 
	igor ->> orca: Fail with Forbidden
	orca ->> gate: TERMINAL
else Authorized
	fiat ->> igor: hasPermissions=true
	igor ->> gh: Check permissions on Repository
	gh ->> igor: Permissions
	igor ->> igor: Evaluate Repo permissions
	alt Unauthorized_onRepo
	igor ->> orca: Fail with Forbidden on Repo Access
	else Authorized_onRepo
	orca ->> gate: IN_PROGRESS
	end
end
```

### How to enable

You enable the `impersonateGitHubTeam` feature per GitHub App account by setting the `impersonateGitHubTeam` block in the `github-integration-plugin.yml` file. For example:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=26-28 36-37" >}}
github:
  plugin:
    accounts:
      - name: FirstAppRepo
        organization:  company-public

          EXECUTE:

        impersonateGitHubTeam:

        permissions:
