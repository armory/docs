* [Get Started]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/setup" >}}): This section contains guides to quickly get you started using core CD-as-a-Service functionality.

* [Tutorials]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/tutorials" >}}): A tutorial is an end-to-end example of how to do accomplish a goal and is comprised of several tasks performed in sequence. For example, a tutorial might show you how to deploy an demo app by cloning a repo, logging in using the CLI, creating a deployment file, and finally deploying the app. Like a task, a tutorial should link to content you should know and items you should complete before starting the tutorial.
* [Reference]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/reference" >}}): This section contains both manually maintained and autogenerated reference material such as a breakdown of the deployment file, canary analysis queries, and CLI command options.

## Concept

Use this page type when you want to introduces a single concept or feature. The content is objective, containing architecture, definitions, rules, and guidelines. Rather than containing a sequence of steps, these pages link to related tasks and tutorials.

A concept page explains what something is, not how to use it. You can link to a Task page that explains how to use the feature.

If you start explaining a second concept on your page, create a new page for the new concept and link to it.

### Structure

Each page must have `frontmatter` at the top of the page so Hugo can compile it into HTML.

```markdown
---
title: <descriptive page title>
linkTitle: <short title for site navigation>
description: >
   <what the page is about; search engines display this in results>
---
```

- `title`: Your page title should contain keyword nouns that search engines can use. For example, if you want to explain how CD-as-a-Service implements Kubernetes HPA, you could create a page title like one of the following:
   - How CD-as-a-Service Implements Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
   - Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling in CD-as-a-Service
- `linkTitle`: This is a short, meaningful version of your title for site navigation. For example, if your title is "How CD-as-a-Service Implements Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling", your `linkTitle` could be "Kubernetes HPA".
- `description`: This is one or two sentences that describe the topic of your page. Hugo compiles this into a `<meta description>` tag. Search engines use this content when displaying search results, so the description should contain keywords. For example, if your title is "How CD-as-a-Service Implements Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling", your description could be "Learn how Armory CD-as-a-Service implements Kubernetes HAP by changing your Kubenetes Deployment to a ReplicaSet and rewriting your HPA to reference that ReplicaSet."

Pull request approvers check the frontmatter fields and can help with good wording for search engine optimization.

The body of your page should have one or more headings that organize your page into meaningful sections.

```markdown
## < heading for concept overview >

## < {{%/* heading "prereq" */%}} >

## < heading for body >

## < {{%/*  heading "nextSteps" */%}} >
```

- `heading for concept overview`: Avoid using "Overview" or "Introduction" as the sole word in the heading. This paragraph should set the context in one or two sentences. You can omit this section if you put your concept overivew in the frontmatter's `description` field. Headings should be short, descriptive, and optimized for search engines.
- `{{%/* heading "prereq" */%}}`: (Optional) Include links to prerequisite material that the reader should know in order to understand your concept. This heading is a Hugo shortcode that compiles to "Before you begin".
- `< heading for body >`: The body should explain the concept or feature. You can include additional headings and subheadings.
- `{{%/*  heading "nextSteps" */%}}`: (Optional) Link to related concepts, tasks, and/or tutorials. This heading is a Hugo shortcode that compiles to "Next steps".

## Task

Think of a task as a use case. A Task page shows you how to do a single procedure by following a short series of steps that produce an intended outcome. Task content expects a minimum level of background knowledge, and each page links to conceptual content that you should be familiar with before you begin the task. Additionally, a task should list prerequisite steps the reader needs to complete before starting the task.

### Structure

Each page must have `frontmatter` at the top of the page so Hugo can compile it into HTML.

```markdown
---
title: <descriptive page title>
linkTitle: <short title for site navigation>
description: >
   <what the page is about; search engines display this in results>

```

- `title`: Your page title should contain keyword nouns that search engines can use. For example, if you want to explain how CD-as-a-Service implements Kubernetes HPA, you could create a page title like one of the following:
   - How CD-as-a-Service Implements Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
   - Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling in CD-as-a-Service

```markdown
## < heading for task overview >

## < {{%/* heading "prereq" */%}} >

```

- `heading for task overview`: Avoid using "Overview" or "Introduction" as the sole word in the heading. This paragraph should set the context in one or two sentences. You can omit this section if you put your task overivew in the frontmatter's `description` field. Headings should be short, descriptive, and optimized for search engines.
- `{{%/* heading "prereq" */%}}`: Include links to prerequisite material that the reader should know or have done in order to perform the task. This heading is a Hugo shortcode that compiles to "Before you begin".
- `< heading for body >`: The body should explain the concept or feature. You can include additional headings and subheadings.
- `{{%/*  heading "nextSteps" */%}}`: (Optional) Link to related concepts, tasks, and/or tutorials. This heading is a Hugo shortcode that compiles to "Next steps".
