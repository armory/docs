linkTitle: Use Shortcodes
description: >
   Use code snippets ("shortcodes") to create content that is outside of Markdown's capabilities. Both Hugo and Docsy provide shortcodes that you can use. Additionally, the Armory docs project has its own shortcodes for rendering headings, linking to a page title, and displaying the contents of a CSV file.
