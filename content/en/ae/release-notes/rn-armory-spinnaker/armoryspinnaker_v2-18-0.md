## 02/14/20 Release Notes

> Note: If you're experiencing production issues after upgrading Spinnaker, rollback to a [previous working version]({{< ref "upgrade-spinnaker#rolling-back-an-upgrade" >}}) and please report issues to [http://go.armory.io/support](http://go.armory.io/support).



## Known Issues

### Dynamic Accounts for Kubernetes

**Fixed in**: 2.21

There is an issue with Dynamic Accounts for Kubernetes where the following issues occur:

* Agents get removed but still run on schedule.
* Force cache refresh times out.
* If you have the clean up agent setup, your data randomly disappears and reappears.  

These issues do not occur immediately, and you may even see modified accounts appear.


### Breaking Changes

Two known breaking changes with this release:
* Lambda stages changed casing on the JSON for the bucket information.  
* Orca SQL Configuration has changed from
```yaml
executionRepository:
  sql:
    enabled: true
  redis:
    enabled: true

  dual:
   enabled: true
   primaryClass: com.netflix.spinnaker.clouddriver.data.task.jedis.RedisTaskRepository
   previousClass: com.netflix.spinnaker.clouddriver.sql.SqlTaskRepository
```
To using a named configuration
```yaml
executionRepository:
  sql:
    enabled: true
  redis:
    enabled: true

  dual:
    enabled: true
    primaryName: sqlExecutionRepository
    previousName: redisExecutionRepository
```

### Known Issues

* **Policy Engine**

    If your OPA policies contain any top level declarations other than `deny`, the Policy Engine prevents pipelines from being saved.

    **Workaround**

    Only use `deny` declarations at the top level. Other declarations can still be used at lower levels of the policy.



# Highlighted Updates
## Armory

##  Spinnaker Community Contributions

This release includes fixes, features, and performance improvements across a wide feature set in Spinnaker. Here we share a summary of notable improvements, followed by the comprehensive changelog.

### Fixes
#### [Clouddriver](#clouddriver)
* **kubernetes:**   On refresh, don't replace credentials that have not changed ([b6c2217c](https://github.com/spinnaker/clouddriver/commit/b6c2217cbed8d6b0d182e8a112c3041bf4f0f27f))
#### [Igor](#igor)
* **concourse:**   add support for concourse artifacts (#549) ([127328c3](https://github.com/spinnaker/igor/commit/127328c35d81776ef8b87a81fe7ab1c536453b91))


### Support for deploying and managing Alibaba Cloud load balancers

### Support for executing CloudFormation ChangeSet
CloudFormation stage allows you to create a change set that allows users to review the changes on the AWS infrastructure before applying them. This new feature enables users to pause the pipeline execution until the user executes the change manually through Deck itself without having to go to AWS console. Users can also configure pre-defined behaviour when the created change set contains a "replacement" in CloudFormation jargon, which can protect users from data-loss and unrecoverable changes in the infrastructure.

### Support for ECS services with multiple target groups
The ECS provider now supports routing traffic from multiple load balancers to your ECS service.

### Add initContainer logs to Kubernetes v2 provider container logs
View your pod initContainer and container logs side by side from the Spinnaker UI.

### Propagate gcloud failures from job executor to task for AppEngine deployments
Errors emitted from gcloud while deploying to AppEngine will now be surfaced via the pipeline json and the pipeline UI.

### Surface managed pipeline template versions and enable versioned actions
The Managed Pipeline Templates V2 UI now displays all versions of a given template. Individual template versions can be viewed, deleted, or used to create a new templated pipeline.

### Add SpEL preview to Evaluate Variables stage
The new Evaluate Variables stage UI allows you to preview the value of your SpEL expressions against past executions.

### Support Postgres as Front50 backend

### Add plugin artifact repository
Added plugin metadata repository to act as source of truth for installed plugins within a spinnaker installation.

### Add ability to invoke existing GCB triggers
The Google Cloud Build stage now provides first-class support for invoking Cloud Build [triggers](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/create-manage-triggers).

### Add exponential backoff to Kayenta query retries
There were already retries, but now there is also backoff.

### Stats collection
Spinnakerâ€™s community stats are now available for users wishing to opt-in. When enabled, the telemetry module sends data about all completed pipelines to a centralized service. See more details in this [blog post](https://blog.spinnaker.io/spinnaker-1-18-release-introduces-spinnaker-community-stats-da140ad4c045).

### Java 11 Migration
The Java 11 JRE runs Front50 and Igor when deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Halyard (or if you consume the official containers in some other way). If this causes problems, or your organization isn't ready to run Java 11 in production, you can specify `deploymentEnvironment.imageVariant: JAVA8` (or `UBUNTU_JAVA8`) in your Halyard config. Please notify sig-platform@spinnaker.io if you run into issues and decide to downgrade.

**All users** need to switch to a Java 11 JRE by Spinnaker 1.21, which is scheduled to be released in early July. We encourage everyone to start testing Spinnaker under a Java 11 JRE now in preparation for the cutover. If you have any concerns about the migration timeline, please reach out to sig-platform@spinnaker.io.

### Clouddriver cache cleanup agent
Resources from deleted Spinnaker accounts will now be purged from the SQL cache automatically. Enable the cleanup agent by adding `sql.unknown-agent-cleanup-agent.enabled: true` to your `clouddriver-local.yml`.

### Kubernetes V1 provider removal scheduled
The Kubernetes V1 provider will be removed in release 1.21. Please check out the [RFC](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/rfc/eol_kubernetes_v1.md) for more details.

For now, pass the complex error object through as 'validationMessage'. Tag it as "hidden" so we don't try to render it elsewhere as a ReactNode.
