### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where under some circumstances the clouddriver `/credentials` endpoint doesnâ€™t return kubernetes accounts.

### Known Issues

* The plugin makes a request to fiat `/sync/roles` endpoint every time an agent connects or accounts are deleted. This can become an issue when having a large number of agents and clouddriver restarts.
* Clouddriver `/credentials` endpoint hits the database twice per account. When having a large number of accounts this can become an issue.
