title: v0.9.47 Armory Agent Clouddriver Plugin (2022-04-13)
toc_hide: true
version: 00.09.47

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where under some circumstances the clouddriver `/credentials` endpoint doesn't return kubernetes accounts.

### Known Issues

* The plugin makes a request to fiat `/sync/roles` endpoint every time an agent connects or accounts are deleted. This can become an issue when having a large number of agents connected to a clouddriver pod that is restarted.
* Clouddriver `/credentials` endpoint hits the database twice per account. When having a large number of accounts this can become an issue.
