## Overview of the Dynamic Accounts feature

The Dynamic Accounts feature gives you the ability to migrate Clouddriver accounts to the Scale Agent either manually automatically by configuring. The Dynamic Accounts API provides migration and creation functionality that supports a batch encapsulation of multiple accounts containing the account definitions within. You can use the API to modify and delete existing accounts that are managed by the Scale Agent.

## Dynamic Accounts glossary

- **Endpoint**: the URL segment after the Clouddriver root
- **Migrate an account**: move a Clouddriver-managed account to the Scale Agent for management
- **Account**: an abstraction of a target cluster or target set of namespaces within a cluster
- **Credentials source**: any source from which credentials/accounts are read
- **Request**: an instruction that isnâ€™t fulfilled immediately and can have different outcomes; a request can be done through HTTP by the admin or internally by one of the services.

## Architecture

Dynamic Accounts extends Clouddriver's Account Management [feature](https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/other_config/accounts/), which uses a database for storing account configuration. The Scale Agent stores account data in a dedicated table called `clouddriver.kubesvc_accounts`. It does not modify or delete the account data in the `clouddriver.accounts` table.

An account has the following lifecycle states:

- Non-transient:

  - `INACTIVE`: This is the initial state. Scale Agent has provisioned the account, but the account is waiting for a migration operation.
  - `ACTIVE`: Scale Agent watches and manages the account.
  - `FAILED`: Scale Agent failed to add or delete an account.
  - `ORPHANED`: Neither Scale Agent nor Clouddriver is managing the account. It is inactive. You usually see this state when restarting or bringing down all of the replicas managing that account.

- Transient

  - `TO_MIGRATE`: The account is waiting for migration.
  - `ACTIVATING`: The account transferred to Scale Agent for activation.
  - `TO_DEACTIVATE`: Indicates there is an instruction to deactivate the account.
  - `DEACTIVATING`: A request to stop watching the account has been sent to the Scale Agent.


### Manual migration flow

Since the Scale Agent endpoints aren't directly accessible, you call them using the publicly exposed Clouddriver API `https://<clouddriver-url>:<clouddriver-port>`.
