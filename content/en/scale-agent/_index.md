## Overview of the Scale Agent

The [Scale Agent for Spinnaker and Kubernetes](https://www.armory.io/products/scale-agent-for-spinnaker-kubernetes/) consists of a lightweight service that you deploy on Kubernetes and a plugin that you install into Clouddriver. With these, you can scale Kubernetes deployments to limitless clusters and namespaces with minimal latency and accelerate pipeline execution times. 

### Advantages of using the Armory Scale Agent

* Scalability
  * Caching and deployment scales to thousands of Kubernetes clusters for your largest applications.
  * By leveraging the Kubernetes `watch` mechanism, the Armory Scale Agent detects changes to Kubernetes and streams them in real time over a single TCP connection per cluster to Spinnaker<sup>TM</sup>.
  * The Agent optimizes how infrastructure information is cached, making _Force Cache Refresh_ almost instantaneous. This means optimal performance for your end users and your pipeline executions.

* Security
  * Keep your Kubernetes API servers private from Spinnaker.
  * Only the information Armory CD needs leaves the cluster.
  * Decentralize your account management. Using Kubernetes Service Accounts, teams control what Spinnaker can do. Add or remove accounts in real time,  and then use them without restarting Spinnaker.
  * Use Kubernetes Service Accounts or store your `kubeconfig` files in one of the supported [secret engines]({{< ref "continuous-deployment/armory-admin/secrets" >}}), or provision them via the method of your choice as Kubernetes secrets.

* Usability
  * Use the Armory Scale Agent alongside Armory CD and benefit from performance improvements.
  * Use the Armory Scale Agent in a target cluster and get Kubernetes accounts automatically registered.
  * Use YAML, a HELM chart, or a Kustomize template to inject the Armory Scale Agent into newly provisioned Kubernetes clusters and immediately make those clusters software deployment targets.
  * Use the Armory Scale Agent with little operational overhead or changes in the way you currently manage Armory CD.

## Docs organization

If you're familiar with the Kubernetes docs, you may notice that the Armory Scale Agent docs are organized in a similar fashion:

* [Get Started]({{< ref "scale-agent/install" >}}): This section contains guides for installing and uninstalling the Armory Scale Agent.
* [Concepts]({{< ref "scale-agent/concepts" >}}): These pages explain aspects of the Armory Scale Agent. The content is objective, containing architecture, definitions, rules, and guidelines. Rather than containing a sequence of steps, these pages link to related tasks and tutorials.
* [Tasks]({{< ref "scale-agent/tasks" >}}): Task pages show you how to do a single procedure by following a short series of steps that produce an intended outcome. Task content expects a minimum level of background knowledge, and each page links to conceptual content that you should be familiar with before you begin the task.
* [Reference]({{< ref "scale-agent/reference" >}}): This section contains both manually maintained and autogenerated reference material for configuring the plugin and service and using the APIs.
* [Release Notes]({{< ref "scale-agent/release-notes" >}})
