## Overview of the Scale Agent

The [Scale Agent for Spinnaker and Kubernetes](https://www.armory.io/products/scale-agent-for-spinnaker-kubernetes/) consists of a lightweight service that you deploy on Kubernetes and a plugin that you install into Clouddriver. With these, you can scale Kubernetes deployments to limitless clusters and namespaces with minimal latency, accelerating your pipeline execution times. 

The Scale Agent works with Armory Continuous Deployment v2.26+ and Spinnaker v1.26+.

### Advantages of using the Armory Scale Agent

* **Scalability**
  * Caching and deployment scales to thousands of Kubernetes clusters for your largest applications.
  * By leveraging the Kubernetes `watch` mechanism, the Armory Scale Agent detects changes to Kubernetes and streams them in real time over a single TCP connection per cluster to Spinnaker<sup>TM</sup>.
  * The Agent optimizes how infrastructure information is cached, making _Force Cache Refresh_ almost instantaneous. This means optimal performance for your end users and your pipeline executions.

* **Security**
  * Keep your Kubernetes API servers private from Spinnaker.
  * Only the information Armory CD needs leaves the cluster.
  * Decentralize your account management. Using Kubernetes Service Accounts, teams control what Spinnaker can do. Add or remove accounts in real time,  and then use them without restarting Spinnaker.
  * Use Kubernetes Service Accounts or store your `kubeconfig` files in one of the supported [secret engines]({{< ref "continuous-deployment/armory-admin/secrets" >}}), or provision them via the method of your choice as Kubernetes secrets.

* **Usability**
  * Use the Armory Scale Agent alongside Armory CD and benefit from performance improvements.
  * Use the Armory Scale Agent in a target cluster and get Kubernetes accounts automatically registered.
  * Use YAML, a HELM chart, or a Kustomize template to inject the Armory Scale Agent into newly provisioned Kubernetes clusters and immediately make those clusters software deployment targets.
  * Use the Armory Scale Agent with little operational overhead or changes in the way you currently manage Armory CD.

## How to get started using the Scale Agent

* **New Spinnaker instance**: The {{< linkWithTitle "scale-agent/install/quickstart.md" >}} guide shows you how to use the Spinnaker Operator to install Spinnaker and the Scale Agent in the same Kubernetes cluster for testing the Scale Agent's features.
* **Existing Spinnaker instance**: How you install the Scale Agent components depends on how you manage your Spinnaker instance. The [Advanced Installation]({{< ref "scale-agent/install/advanced/_index.md" >}}) section covers installation using Halyard for the plugin and `kubectl` or Helm for the service. 
* **Existing Armory Continuous Deployment instance**: The [Advanced Installation]({{< ref "scale-agent/install/advanced/_index.md" >}}) section covers how to use the Armory Operator to install the Scale Agent components. @TODO USING THE ARMORY OPERATOR AND SPINNAKER OPERATOR IS BASICALLY THE SAME.  

@TODO ADVANCED SHOULD COVER USING THE PLUGIN DOCKER IMAGE

>For installation into existing instances, note that your Clouddriver service must use a MySQL-compatible database. If yours doesn't, see the {{< linkWithTitle "clouddriver-sql-configure.md" >}} guide for instructions.

## Docs organization

If you're familiar with the Kubernetes docs, you may notice that the Armory Scale Agent docs are organized in a similar fashion:

* [Get Started]({{< ref "scale-agent/install" >}}): This section contains guides for installing and uninstalling the Armory Scale Agent.
* [Concepts]({{< ref "scale-agent/concepts" >}}): These pages explain aspects of the Armory Scale Agent. The content is objective, containing architecture, definitions, rules, and guidelines. Rather than containing a sequence of steps, these pages link to related tasks and tutorials.
* [Tasks]({{< ref "scale-agent/tasks" >}}): Task pages show you how to do a single procedure by following a short series of steps that produce an intended outcome. Task content expects a minimum level of background knowledge, and each page links to conceptual content that you should be familiar with before you begin the task.
* [Reference]({{< ref "scale-agent/reference" >}}): This section contains both manually maintained and autogenerated reference material for configuring the plugin and service and using the APIs.
* [Release Notes]({{< ref "scale-agent/release-notes" >}})
