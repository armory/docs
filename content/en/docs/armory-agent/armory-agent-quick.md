## Compatibility matrix

{{< include "agent/agent-compat-matrix.md" >}}

The Agent consists of a service deployed as a Kubernetes `Deployment` and a plugin to Spinnaker's Clouddriver service. You can review the architecture in the Armory Agent [overview]({{< ref "armory-agent" >}}).

## {{% heading "prereq" %}}

* This guide is for experienced Kubernetes and Armory Enterprise users.
* You have read the Armory Agent [overview]({{< ref "armory-agent" >}}).
* You have a Redis instance. The Agent uses Redis to coordinate between Clouddriver replicas.
* You have configured Clouddriver to use MySQL or PostgreSQL. See the {{< linkWithTitle "clouddriver-sql-configure.md" >}} guide for instructions.

## Networking requirements

Communication between Clouddriver and the Agent must be `http/2`. `http/1.1` is *not* compatible and causes communication issues between Clouddriver and the Agent.

## Kubernetes permissions needed by the Agent

The Agent should have `ClusterRole` authorization if you need to deploy pods across your cluster or `Role` authorization if you deploy pods only to a single namespace.

* If Agent is running in [Agent Mode]({{< ref "armory-agent#agent-mode" >}}), then the `ClusterRole` or `Role` is the one attached to the Kubernetes Service Account mounted by the Agent pod.
* If Agent is running in any of the other modes, then the `ClusterRole` or `Role` is the one the `kubeconfigFile` uses to interact with the target cluster. `kubeconfigFile` is configured in `kubesvc.yml` of the Agent pod.

Example configuration for deploying `Pod` manifests:

{{< tabs name="agent-permissions" >}}
{{% tab name="ClusterRole" %}}

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: agent-role
rules:
- apiGroups: ""
  resources:
  - pods
  - pods/log
  - pods/finalizers
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
  - create
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Role" %}}

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: agent-role
rules:
- apiGroups: ""
  resources:
  - pods
  - pods/log
  - pods/finalizers
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
  - create
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

You can see a more detailed example of the kind of `ClusterRole` permissions you may need in the `spinnaker-kustomize-patch` repo's `spin-sa.yml` [file](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-kustomize-patches/blob/master/accounts/kubernetes/spin-sa.yml#L5).

See the Kubernetes [Using RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) guide for details on configuring `ClusterRole` and `Role` authorization.

## Step 1: Agent plugin installation

You modify the current Clouddriver deployment as well as add a new Kubernetes `Service`.

The easiest installation path is to modify an existing [`spinnakerservice.yaml`]({{< ref "op-config-manifest" >}}) with [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/). To start, download additional manifests into the directory with your `SpinnakerService`:

```bash
# AGENT_PLUGIN_VERSION is found in the compatibility matrix above
curl https://armory.jfrog.io/artifactory/manifests/kubesvc-plugin/agent-plugin-$AGENT_PLUGIN_VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xJvf -
```

Then include the manifests in your current kustomization:

{{< prism lang="yaml" line="6-11" >}}
# Existing kustomization.yaml
namespace: spinnaker  #   could be different
resources:
  - spinnakerservice.yaml

bases:
  - agent-service

patchesStrategicMerge:
  - agent-plugin/config.yaml
  - agent-plugin/clouddriver-plugin.yaml
{{</ prism >}}

You can then set the [plugin options]({{< ref "agent-plugin-options" >}}) in `agent-plugin/config.yaml`.

* For topologies like [Infrastructure mode]({{< ref "armory-agent#infrastructure-mode" >}}) and [Agent mode]({{< ref "armory-agent#agent-mode" >}}), in which the Agent is installed in a different cluster from Spinnaker, you should configure TLS through a load balancer.
* For Spinnaker installations with one Clouddriver instance and no Redis, you can use `kubesvc.cluster`. However, a Spinnaker installation with Redis is recommended.
* When running Spinnaker in [HA](https://spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/high-availability/), make sure to modify the following files:

  * `agent-service/kustomization.yaml` according to its comments
  * `agent-plugin/clouddriver-plugin.yaml` and `agent-plugin/config.yaml` references to Clouddriver should be to HA versions (i.e: `-rw`, `-ro`, etc)

When you're ready, deploy with:

```bash
kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
```

Note:

- If you gave `SpinnakerService` a name other than `spinnaker`, you need to change it in files under `agent-plugin`.
- If you are using the Agent on an OSS installation, use the following download URL `https://armory.jfrog.io/artifactory/manifests/kubesvc-plugin/agent-oss-plugin-${AGENT_PLUGIN_VERSION}-tar.gz` or replace the `apiVersion` with `spinnaker.io/v1alpha2`.

### Alternate methods

If you are not using Kustomize, you can still use the same manifests.

- Deploy `agent-service/clouddriver-grpc-service.yaml` or `agent-service/clouddriver-ha-grpc-service.yaml` if using Clouddriver "HA" (caching, rw, ro).
- Merge `agent-plugin/config.yaml` and `agent-plugin/clouddriver-plugin.yaml` into your existing `SpinnakerService`.


## Step 2: Agent installation

Now lets deploy the Armory Agent itself. Armory provides a kustomize directory which already includes a basic configuration.
You can download it by running these commands:

```bash
mkdir armory-agent
curl https://armory.jfrog.io/artifactory/manifests/kubesvc/armory-agent-{{<param kubesvc-version>}}-kustomize.tar.gz | tar -xJvf - -C armory-agent
```

You will have these files:

 * `kustomization.yaml` is kustomize entrypoint, refers and overrides the two other files.
 * `kubesvc.yaml`  contains the [Agent options]({{< ref "agent-options" >}}):
   * For installations without gRPC TLS connections, you should include `clouddriver.insecure: true` in the Agent options.
   * For HA, make sure to set `clouddriver.grpc: clouddriver-ha-grpc-service.yaml:9091`
 * `deployment.yaml` is the basic deployment maifest for Armory Agent

If you already have a kustomization directory for your SpinnakerService manifest,
you can include this `armory-agent` directory as a kustomize base:

{{< prism lang="yaml" line="8" >}}
# Existing kustomization.yaml
namespace: spinnaker
resources:
  - spinnakerservice.yaml

bases:
  - agent-service
  - armory-agent

patchesStrategicMerge:
  - agent-plugin/config.yaml
  - agent-plugin/clouddriver-plugin.yaml
{{</ prism >}}

### Configuring accounts

Accounts are part of the [Agent Options]({{< ref "agent-options" >}}) which can be modified in `kubesvc.yaml` file

```yaml
# ./kubesvc.yaml
kubernetes:
  accounts:
  - name: account01
    kubeconfigFile: /kubeconfigfiles/kubecfg-account01.yaml
```

By default, agent mounts a secret named `kubeconfigs-secret` under its directory `/kubeconfigfiles`,
which in this example we will configure in our existing main `kustomization.yaml`:

{{< prism lang="yaml" line="14-17" >}}
# Existing kustomization.yaml
namespace: spinnaker
resources:
  - spinnakerservice.yaml

bases:
  - agent-service
  - armory-agent

patchesStrategicMerge:
  - agent-plugin/config.yaml
  - agent-plugin/clouddriver-plugin.yaml

secretGenerator:
  - name: kubeconfigs-secret
    files:
    - kubeconfigfiles/kubecfg-account01.yaml
{{</ prism >}}

 * Note: if you prefer not to include this secrets under the main kustomize directory. You can
   instead use `encryptedFile` for referring to [S3 secrets]({{< ref "secrets-s3#referencing-secrets" >}}) or [Vault Secrets]({{< ref "secrets-vault#referencing-secrets"  >}}) and leave the
   `kubeconfigs-secret` file list as empty in the main kustomization file:

  ```
  secretGenerator:
    - name: kubeconfigs-secret
      files: []
  ```

Finally, we can now include the actual `kubeconfig` for kubectl in our main kustomize directory under a new subfolder named `./kubeconfigfiles/`.
The finall folder structure now should look similar to this:

```
.                                        # Main kustomize folder
├── kustomization.yml                    # Main kustomization file
├── agent-service                        # New kubernetes Services for Agent
│   ├── clouddriver-grpc-service.yaml
│   ├── clouddriver-ha-grpc-service.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml               ## Kustomization file for new Services
├── armory-agent                         # Armory Agent deployment
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── kubesvc.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml               ## Armory Agent kustomization file
├── agent-plugin                         # Armory Agent plugin for Clouddriver
│   ├── clouddriver-plugin.yaml
│   └── config.yaml
├── kubeconfigfiles
│   └── kubecfg-account01.yaml           # Kubeconfig file with access to your cluster
└── spinnakerservice.yaml                # SpinnakerService manifest
```

With the directory structure in place, deploy the Agent service:

```bash
kustomize build </path/to/directory> | kubectl apply -f -
```
