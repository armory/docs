## Observability

{{% alert %}}Armory Enterprise 2.20 and later require the Observability plugin for monitoring Spinnaker. Versions earlier than 2.20 use the Spinnaker monitoring daemon, which is deprecated. {{% /alert %}}

| ELK        | All supported versions |      |

## Persistent storage

Depending on the service, Spinnaker can use either Redis or MySQL as the backing store. The following table lists the supported database and the Spinnaker service:

| Database | DB version            | Armory Enterprise      | Spinnaker services                                  | Note                                                                                                                       |
|----------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Redis    | X.Y.Z                 | All supported versions | All Spinnaker services that require a backing store | The DB versions refer to external Redis instances. By default, Spinnaker deploys Redis internally to support its services. |
| MySQL    | MySQL 5.7 (or Aurora) | All supported versions | Clouddriver, Front50, Orca                          |                                                                                                                            |

Armory recommends using MySQL as the backing store when possible for production instances of Spinnaker. For other services, use an external Redis instance for production instances of Spinnaker.
