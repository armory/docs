## Prerequisites

[Configure Github to post push events](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/tutorials/codelabs/kubernetes-v2-source-to-prod/#allow-github-to-post-push-events)

[Add two Kubernetes accounts (staging and prod)](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/tutorials/codelabs/kubernetes-v2-source-to-prod/#configure-kubernetes)

## Overview of promoting artifacts between environments

One of the more powerful and common uses of Spinnaker is the promotion of
an artifact through a series of environments, i.e. from *staging* to *prod*.

In such a workflow, a pipeline might initially be triggered by the creation or
modification of an artifact. While the artifact itself may be a manifest, a
Docker image, or a number of other possibilities, what is important is that
once it is initially deployed, the artifact's subsequent promotion is
dependent on the result of the artifact's deployment to the previous
environment.

Determining promotion success can be accomplished through the completion of
integration tests or another automated method but it can also be determined
through manual judgement. We make use of the latter case in our example below.

Below is an example where we deploy an artifact to our *staging* environment.
The successful completion of this pipeline then triggers another pipeline
configured with a `Manual Judgement` stage. If *manual judgement* succeeds, a
third stage is triggered which takes the same artifact we initially deployed
into our *staging* environment and deploys it to our *production* environment.

### Deploy to Staging

We begin by creating a new application named `artifact-promotion-demo`. Once
you have created your application, click on `Pipelines` and then `Configure
a new pipeline`.

We want this initial pipeline to be responsible for our artifact's deployment
to *staging*. With this in mind, we have named it `Deploy to Staging`

You should now configure the expected artifacts for your pipeline and specify
how your pipeline should be triggered. In our example we have specified a
manifest (stored in our Github repo) as our artifact and set our pipeline to
trigger automatically when changes to our manifest are detected.

Next, click `Add stage`. Provide your new stage a descriptive name -- we have
chosen `Deploy to Staging` as ours. In order to deply our artifact, we choose
`Deploy (Manifest)` as our *Stage Type* and specify `Artifact` as our *Manifest
Source*. Finally, we select our arfifact from the `Expected Artifact` dropdown.

Save your changes.

### Validate your Deployment

Now that we have a pipeline deploying to staging, we want validate that the
deployment was successful before promoting our artifact to production.

Click `Pipelines` and then click `+ Create` to create a new pipeline. We have
named ours `Staging Judgement`.

Add an automated trigger to the pipeline where the type is `Pipeline`. Select
the `Deploy to Staging` pipeline from the `Pipeline` dropdown. Check both
`successful` and `Trigger Enabled` from the remaining options.

Now click, `Add stage` and select `Manual Judgement` as the *Stage Type*. In
*Execution Options* select `halt the entire pipeline` for *If stage fails*.
Additionally, you can provide additional instructions in the *Instructions*
text-area.

Save your changes.

### Deploy to Production

We are now ready to create the pipeline responsible for deploying
our artifact to *production*.

Click `Pipelines` and then click `+ Create` to create a new pipeline. We have
named this one `Deploy to Production` and have made use of the `Copy From`
dropdown in order to copy our `Deploy to Staging` pipeline.

![Copy Staging Pipeline](/images/Image-2018-10-23-at-1.48.19-PM.png)

You will want to delete the *Automated Trigger* copied from our `Deploy to
Staging` pipeline. In its place, create a new one of *Type* `Pipeline`. In
the *Pipeline* dropdown select `Staging Judgement`. Lastly, select
`successful` for *Pipeline Status* and select `Trigger Enabled`

![Automated Trigger](/images/Image-2018-10-23-at-1.50.56-PM.png)

Finally, add a new stage of type `Deploy (Manifest)`. The configuration for this
stage should mirror the configuration of the `Deploy (Manifest)` stage of
the *Deploy to Staging* pipeline with the exception that specified account
should correspond to your production environment.

## Summary

We have just shown an example of promoting a single artifact through a
series of environments. While we relied on a *Manual Judgement* stage in order to
validate the deployment of our artifact to *staging* before deploying it to
*production*, we could also have used automated methods such as the
successful completion of integration tests or through the use of canary analysis.
Finally, although the example relied on only two distinct environments, adding
additional environments is trivial.
