## Overview

Armory Cloud is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform for continuous delivery that integrates with your existing tools.

As a SaaS platform, Armory Cloud gives you the ability to deliver software without the maintenance overhead of having to maintain your own continuous delivery tools.

The two components of Armory Cloud are the Armory Cloud Console and a cloud instance of the Armory Platform. Armory Cloud Console is the administrator portal for Armory Cloud where you perform configuration related tasks, such as adding a new deployment target. Use it to configure your Armory Cloud instance and integrations with your existing tools. 

The Armory Platform, which includes Armory's enterprise extensions and Spinnakerâ„¢, is where your app developers create and manage their delivery pipelines within the environments you define.
