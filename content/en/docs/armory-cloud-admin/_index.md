## Overview

Armory Cloud is a SaaS platform for continuous delivery that integrates with your existing tools:

- Artifact stores, such as GitHub, to fetch things like images
- Cloud Providers, such as AWS, to deploy your apps to

The two main components of Armory Cloud are Armory Cloud Console and a cloud instance of the Armory Platform. Armory Cloud Console is the administrator portal for Armory Cloud. You can perform administrative and operations related tasks, including configuring your Armory Cloud environments (such as sandbox and production environments) and the integrations mentioned above. The Armory Platform, which includes Armory's enterprise extensions and Spinnakerâ„¢, is where your app developers create and manage their delivery pipelines within the environments you defined.
