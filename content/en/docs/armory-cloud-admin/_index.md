## Overview

Armory Cloud is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform for continuous delivery that integrates with your existing tools. As a SaaS solution, Armory Cloud gives you the ability to deliver software without the maintenance overhead of having to maintain your own continuous delivery tools.

The two components of Armory Cloud are the Armory Cloud Console and the Armory Cloud platform. Armory Cloud Console is the administrator portal for Armory Cloud where you perform configuration tasks, such as adding a new deployment target or managing your configuration secrets. Use it to configure your Armory Cloud instance and integrations with your existing tools.

Armory Cloud, which includes Armory's enterprise extensions and Spinnakerâ„¢, is where your app developers create and manage their delivery pipelines with the environments defined in the Cloud Console.

Armory is also developing and iterating on new features for the Armory Platform and app developers as part of the SaaS development process. For information about that, see [Armory Cloud Preview]({{< ref "armory-cloud-preview" >}}).
