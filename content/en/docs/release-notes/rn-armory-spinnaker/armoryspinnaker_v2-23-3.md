#### AWS image caching

There is an issue where Clouddriver fails to cache images that belong to the first account (alphabetically) for each region. For example, in a region with accounts named Edith, Milton, and Pixel, Edith's images do not get cached.

**Affected versions**: 2.23.x

**Fixed versions**: 2.24.0

**Workaround**: 

Two workarounds exist for this issue:

- **Option 1**: Add an account with a name that comes first alphabetically. Then, turn off the agents for that account using the `sql.agent.disabledAgents` parameter in `clouddriver-local.yml` or the equivalent section of your Operator config file. Use regex for the value instead of attempting to create a list manually.

- **Option 2**: In `clouddriver-local.yml` or the equivalent section of your Operator config file, disable public image caching with the following parameter: `aws.defaults.publicImages.enabled: false`.

## Highlighted updates

<!--
Each item category (such as UI) under here should be an h3 (###). List the following info that service owners should be able to provide:
- Major changes or new features we want to call out for Armory and OSS. Changes should be grouped under end user understandable sections. For example, instead of Deck, use UI. Instead of Fiat, use Permissions.
- Fixes to any known issues from previous versions that we have in release notes. These can all be grouped under a Fixed issues H3.
-->

This release includes bug fixes and performance improvements.
