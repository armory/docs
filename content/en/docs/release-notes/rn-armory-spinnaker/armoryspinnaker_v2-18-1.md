## 04/03/20 Release Notes

> Note: If you're experiencing production issues after upgrading Spinnaker, rollback to a [previous working version]({{< ref "upgrade-spinnaker#rolling-back-an-upgrade" >}}) and please report issues to [http://go.armory.io/support](http://go.armory.io/support).



## Known Issues

### Halyard version

There is a known issue where Armory-extended Halyard 1.9.0 fails to install Armory 2.18.1. The Pod for Echo enters a crash loop.

**Workaround**

Use Armory-extended Halyard 1.8.3 if you want to install Armory 2.18.1.

### Dynamic Accounts for Kubernetes

**Fixed in**: 2.21

There is an issue with Dynamic Accounts for Kubernetes where the following issues occur:

* Agents get removed but still run on schedule.
* Force cache refresh times out.
* If you have the clean up agent setup, your data randomly disappears and reappears.  

These issues do not occur immediately, and you may even see modified accounts appear.

## Highlighted Updates
### Armory
This release includes the following:
  - Improved error handling in Pipelines as Code and its microservice, Dinghy.
  - The Terraform integration now uses Clouddriver's built-in support for `git/repo` artifact types. Previously, you had to create a custom artifact that was a `git/repo` type.
  - Improved edge case handling in Policy Engine to better support more complex policies that include other top-level declarations besides `deny`. This resolves a previous known issue with Policy Engine where OPA policies that contain a top level declaration other than `deny` prevent any pipeline from being saved.
  - Addressed a number of CVE's related to `springframework`, `tomcat`, and `jackson-databind` found in Spinnaker Java services.



###  Spinnaker Community Contributions

There have also been numerous enhancements, fixes and features across all of Spinnaker's services from the open source community. See their changes here: [Spinnaker's v1.18.7](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-18-7-changelog).
