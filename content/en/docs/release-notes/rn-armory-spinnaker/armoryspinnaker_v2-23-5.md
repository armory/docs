## Highlighted updates

### Cloudfoundry

Improved how  Spring Cloud Config and another dynamic account solutions perform. Credentials definition now get compared against existing definitions. This ensures that Armory only updates credentials when they are updated orchanged.
This improvement also adds an annotation to ensure credentials are compared correctly with the equals operation.
