#### Failing health checks when using dynamic accounts 
<!-- BOB-30122 -->

There is a known issue where the health checks for the Clouddriver pod fail when the following conditions are true:

* Spinnaker is configured to use Spring Cloud Config Dynamic Accounts backed by Vault using a K/V Secrets Engine v2.
* Spinnaker is configured to use Armory Vault Secrets.

The health check failure prevents Kubernetes from transitioning the Clouddriver pod to a ready and active state, which prevents Kubernetes from passing traffic to the Clouddriver pod.

There is currently no workaround.

**Affected versions**: 2.23.4

### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where Clouddriver fails to cache images that belong to the first account (alphabetically) for each region.  

## Highlighted updates

<!--
Each item category (such as UI) under here should be an h3 (###). List the following info that service owners should be able to provide:
- Major changes or new features we want to call out for Armory and OSS. Changes should be grouped under end user understandable sections. For example, instead of Deck, use UI. Instead of Fiat, use Permissions.
- Fixes to any known issues from previous versions that we have in release notes. These can all be grouped under a Fixed issues H3.
-->

This release includes various improvements to security and performance.
