## 2021/01/21 Release Notes

> Note: If you're experiencing production issues after upgrading Spinnaker, rollback to a [previous working version]({{< ref "upgrade-spinnaker#rolling-back-an-upgrade" >}}) and please report issues to [http://go.armory.io/support](http://go.armory.io/support).
## Required Halyard or Operator version

To install, upgrade, or configure Armory 2.24.0, use one of the following tools:

- Armory-extended Halyard 1.10 or later
- Armory Operator 1.2.1 or later

## Security

Armory scans the codebase as we develop and release software. Contact your Armory account representative for information about CVE scans for this release.

## Breaking changes
<!-- Copy/paste from the previous version if there are recent ones. We can drop breaking changes after 3 minor versions. Add new ones from OSS and Armory. -->
{{< include "bc-docker-giduid.md" >}}

{{< include "bc-k8s-job-suffix.md" >}}

<!-- Moved this to Breaking changes instead of KI. Didn't bother renaming it. -->
{{< include "ki-orca-zombie-execution.md" >}}

{{< include "bc-orca-forcecacherefresh.md" >}}

## Known issues
<!-- Copy/paste known issues from the previous version if they're not fixed. Add new ones from OSS and Armory. If there aren't any issues, state that so readers don't think we forgot to fill out this section. -->

{{< include "ki-bake-var-file.md" >}}
{{< include "ki-lambda-ui-caching.md" >}}

### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue where Clouddriver fails to cache the images for the account that comes first (alphabetically) in each region.

## Highlighted updates

<!--
Each item category (such as UI) under here should be an h3 (###). List the following info that service owners should be able to provide:
- Major changes or new features we want to call out for Armory and OSS. Changes should be grouped under end user understandable sections. For example, instead of Deck, use UI. Instead of Fiat, use Permissions.
- Fixes to any known issues from previous versions that we have in release notes. These can all be grouped under a Fixed issues H3.
-->

### Baking

* You can now use `git/repo` artifacts when baking a helm chart.
* Rosco now supports using a secure connection to Redis

### Deployment targets

#### AWS ECS

Improvements to ECS include the following:

- Tag-based Moniker naming strategies are now supported for ECS. For more information, see [Moniker](https://spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-24-0-changelog#moniker-support-for-amazon-ecs).
- Better ECS performance.

#### Clouddriver

You can now use PostgresSQL 10 or later as the backing store for Clouddriver. 

#### Cloud Foundry

Improvements to the Cloud Foundry provider include the following:

* Droplets do not have to be restaged after a service gets bound anymore.
* The endpoints now use `/v3` to provide more granular control over READ/WRITES.
* You can now filter based on location and space. This gives you the ability to scope your Spinnaker to a specific organization or space, limiting the resources, operations, and caching to a specific organization or space.


### Pipelines as Code

Pipelines as Code now supports using MySQL as the backing store, which can provide more durability and scalability than Redis. This feature is currently in early access.

For information about how to configure the backing store for Pipelines as Code, see [Configuring SQL]({{< ref "dinghy-enable#configuring-redis" >}}).

### Terraform Integration

The Terraform Integration now supports the following Terraform versions: 0.13.4, 0.13.5, 0.14.0, 0.14.1, 0.14.2

Additionally, the integration is now more resilient. It will retry if it fails to fetch artifacts from Clouddriver. Configure this feature in your `terraformer-local.yml` file.

The following example enables retries and sets the minimum wait between attempts to 4 seconds, the maximum wait between attempts to 8s, and the maximum number of retries to 5.

```
# terraformer-local.yml
clouddriver:
  retry:
    enabled: true
    minWait: 4s # must be a duration, such as 4s for 4 seconds
  maxWait: 8s # must be a duration, such as 8s for 8 seconds
  maxRetries: 5
```

### UI

Nested pipelines now have a breadcrumb trail that shows parent executions, making it easier to see and navigate the context.

###  Spinnaker Community Contributions

There have also been numerous enhancements, fixes, and features across all of Spinnaker's other services. See the
[Spinnaker v1.24.2](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-24-2-changelog) changelog for details.
