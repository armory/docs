## 2021/09/03 Release Notes

> Note: If you're experiencing production issues after upgrading Spinnaker, rollback to a [previous working version]({{< ref "upgrade-spinnaker#rolling-back-an-upgrade" >}}) and please report issues to [http://go.armory.io/support](http://go.armory.io/support).

## Required Halyard or Operator version

To install, upgrade, or configure Armory 2.26.2, use one of the following tools:

- Armory-extended Halyard 1.12 or later
  - 2.26.x is the last minor release that you can use Halyard to install or manage. Future releases require the Armory Operator. For more information, see [Halyard Deprecation]({{< ref "halyard-deprecation" >}}).

- Armory Operator 1.2.6 or later

   For information about upgrading, Operator, see [Upgrade the Operator]({{< ref "op-manage-operator#upgrade-the-operator" >}}).


## Security

Armory scans the codebase as we develop and release software. Contact your Armory account representative for information about CVE scans for this release.

## Highlighted updates

<!--
Each item category (such as UI) under here should be an h3 (###). List the following info that service owners should be able to provide:
- Major changes or new features we want to call out for Armory and OSS. Changes should be grouped under end user understandable sections. For example, instead of Deck, use UI. Instead of Fiat, use Permissions.
- Fixes to any known issues from previous versions that we have in release notes. These can all be grouped under a Fixed issues H3.
-->
### Artifacts 

This release includes the following improvements for git-based artifact providers:

* The GitRepo artifact provider now supports token files. Use the `tokenFile:` (Operator) or `--token-file` (Halyard) parameters to specify a token file.
* The GitHub, GitLab, and GitRepo artifact providers now support token files that are dynamically updated. The token file is automatically reloaded when Armory Enterprise makes a request.

### AWS ECS

Resolved an issue where the subnets and server groups were not being cached.

### AWS Lambda 

> These improvements require version 1.0.8 of the AWS Lambda Plugin in addition to Armory Enterprise 2.26.2.

This release includes the following new features and improvements for the Lambda provider:

* Fixed an issue where a [UI bug](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/6271) related to the caching agent prevented Lambda functions from being displayed in the UI when there are no other clusters associated with the Application.
* Improved cache performance including fixes to cache issues found in 2.24.2
* New configuration properties that give you greater control over how Armory Enterprise behaves when connection or cache issues occur.

Configure the following properties in your Operator manifest (`spinnakerservice.yml` by default). Note that all these properties are optional and use the default if omitted. 

`spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles.orca.spinnaker.`:

- `cloudDriverReadTimeout`: Integer. The timeout (in seconds) when attempting to read from Lambda. (Defaults to 60 seconds.)
- `cloudDriverConnectTimeout`: Integer. The connection timeout (in seconds) when trying to connect to AWS Lambda from Clouddriver. (Defaults to 15 seconds.)
- `cacheRefreshRetryWaitTime`: Integer. The time (in seconds) to wait between retries when attempting to refresh the Lambda cache stored in Clouddriver. (Defaults to 15 seconds.)
- `cacheOnDemandRetryWaitTime`: Integer. The time (in seconds) to wait between retries when attempting to refresh the cache on-demand. (Defaults to 15 seconds.)

For example:

```yaml
# This example only shows the location of the properties. The rest of the manifest is omitted for brevity.
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      orca:
        lambdaPluginConfig:
          cloudDriverReadTimeout: 30
          cloudDriverConnectTimeout: 10
          cacheRefreshRetryWaitTime: 10
          CacheOnDemandRetryWaitTime: 10
```

`spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles.clouddriver.aws.lambda.`:

- `retry.timeout`: Integer. The time (in minutes) that Clouddriver will wait before timing out when attempting to connect to the Lambda client. (Defaults to 15 minutes.)
- `concurrency.threads`: Integer. The maximum number of threads to use for calls to the Lambda client. (Defaults to 10 threads.) 

For example:

```yaml
# This example only shows the location of the properties. The rest of the manifest is omitted for brevity.
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      clouddriver:
        aws:
          enabled: true
          lambda:
            enabled: true
            retry:              
              timeout: 10  
            concurrency:                   
              threads: 5  
```

### Pipelines as Code

#### Strict JSON Validation

Pipelines as Code (PaC) will now attempt a strict JSON validation of template modules and pipelines to catch certain syntactical errors sooner. This behavior may break existing users that make heavy use of template language constructs. If you find that behavior has changed and need to revert to the previous parsing behavior, add the `jsonValidationDisabled` config to your PaC profile:

```yaml
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      dinghy:
        jsonValidationDisabled: true
```

#### Event notifications honor global config

PaC will now honor configurations that define a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise instance when sending GitHub notifications. No configuration change is necessary for this fix to take effect.

### Spinnaker Community Contributions

There have also been numerous enhancements, fixes, and features across all of Spinnaker's other services. See the
[Spinnaker v1.26.6](https://www.spinnaker.io/changelogs/1.26.6-changelog/) changelog for details.
