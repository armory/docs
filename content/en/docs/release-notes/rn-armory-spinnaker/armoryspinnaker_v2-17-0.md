## 11/14/19 Release Notes


> Note: If you're experiencing production issues after upgrading Spinnaker, rollback to a [previous working version]({{< ref "upgrade-spinnaker#rolling-back-an-upgrade" >}}) and please report issues to [http://go.armory.io/support](http://go.armory.io/support).


## Known Issues
This release has a problem where Kayenta does not start properly. This issue is fixed with Armory `2.17.1`

## Highlighted Updates
### Armory

#### Prometheus metrics in Terraformer
Terraformer now supports Prometheus metrics. The scraping interval of these metrics is configurable but defaults to `30s`.  Finally, the metrics endpoint is exposed at `/metrics`.

#### Horizontal Scaling of Terraformer

Terraformer jobs are now persisted to the data store before being submitted to the queue. This new behavior allows Terraformer to be horizontally scaled.

#### Deck Plugin Support - Alpha
Deck is now able to consume Plugins, enabling UI creation for custom stages.

###  Spinnaker Community Contributions

#### Git Repo Artifact Support
In 1.17 we’ve added support for representing Git repositories as artifacts. The intent for this type of artifact is to enable us to build features around tools that work with a collection of files rather than a single file, like the Deploy (Manifest) stage. Currently, this artifact type is only supported by the Bake (Manifest) stage when using the Kustomize rendering engine but other areas are being explored to determine where this might make sense. Halyard support for configuring this artifact type is forthcoming. See [the proposal](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/4824) for more details.

#### Improved Kustomize Support
Support for Kustomize has been improved to utilize the Git Repo artifact type which should make it more broadly useable. The previous implementation was limited to a small subset of artifact types, like GitHub File. This new artifact support will enable use by teams using any type of Git hosting service including (but not limited to) GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. Be aware, if you’ve used Kustomize in a previous release, configuration of the stage has changed and will need to be updated. Instructions for using Kustomize in 1.17 can be found [here](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/kustomize-manifests/).

#### Kubernetes Deployment Rolling-Restart Support
After years of [demand](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/13488) from the Kubernetes community, a command for initiating a rolling restart of Deployment pods landed in kubectl 1.15 with [kubectl rollout restart](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-em-restart-em-). Spinnaker now provides first-class support for initiating rolling restarts of Deployment pods alongside Deck’s other ad-hoc infrastructure actions.

#### GCE Regional Server Group Guest Accelerator Support
Google Compute Engine supports adding additional GPUs to VMs, and there is now first-class support in Spinnaker for configuring additional hardware for the instances of a regional server group with multiple zones explicitly selected.

#### Fixes to GCE Red/Black Deployments
In a GCE red/black, we previously pinned the source server group’s minimum capacity to its desired capacity before executing the rollout. As of 1.17, we will bring the GCE red/black implementation to parity with the AWS implementation and no longer adjust the source server group’s minimum capacity. The potential drawback to this is that during the period when both the source and target server groups are taking traffic, an autoscaler may scale down the source server group as it will only be taking 50% of the traffic: in the case a rollback is necessary, it will need to scale back up. However, as Netflix has experienced, the potential downsides of pinning the source server group are much worse, as there are many unpredictable ways to get into a state where the server group is never unpinned (see Netflix post-mortem [here](https://twitter.com/FakeRyanGosling/status/1106714429247221761)).

#### Improved isolation between Kubernetes V2 accounts
Clouddriver will start up significantly faster for users with many Kubernetes V2 accounts as of Spinnaker 1.17.  In addition, an error communicating with one account’s cluster will not affect the functionality of other accounts; users will still be able to see resources for and deploy to unaffected accounts.  Prior to this release, an error communicating with one account’s cluster would degrade functionality for other Kubernetes V2 accounts.

#### More flexible authorization model
Fiat now accepts permissions coming from different sources. The legacy permissions for applications, for example, are stored inside the application itself in front50. However, it is possible now to provide those permissions from multiple sources (the legacy being one of those sources), and to decide how the permissions coming from those different sources are to be resolved.

The default resolution strategy of the permission sources just reads from the legacy source. To override it for applications for example, the user must provide a value other than `default` to the parameter `auth.permissions.provider.application`. Currently, the only possible values are `default`, which only reads from the legacy source, or `aggregate`, which reads from all available sources, and adds their permissions.

The currently available sources are the legacy sources, which are enabled by default, but could be disabled by setting the following parameters to false:
* `auth.permissions.source.account.resource.enabled`
* `auth.permissions.source.application.front50.enabled`
* `auth.permissions.source.build-service.resource.enabled`

Applications also have a new source (disabled by default), which applies permissions to any application whose name starts with a given prefix. Below is a sample configuration of this permission source:

```yaml
auth.permissions.source.application.prefix:
  enabled: true
  prefixes:
    - prefix: "fooapp"
      permissions:
        READ:
          - "foo-readers-role@mycompany.org"
    - prefix: "bar*"
      permissions:
        CREATE:
          - "bar-ops-team@mycompany.org"
```

This will apply the READ restriction only on app `fooapp`, and the CREATE restriction on all apps starting with bar. If multiple prefixes match a given app, they are resolved using the resolution strategy provided in `auth.permissions.source.application.prefix.resolutionStrategy`, which could either be `AGGREGATE`, meaning the permissions will be aggregated from all matching prefixes, or `MOST_SPECIFIC`, meaning that only the permissions from the most-specific prefix will be applied.

#### Restrict application creation permissions:

**Note**: When configuring permissions, you must explicitly configure permissions for each user role. The default for a user role is no permissions, which means it cannot perform any actions.

Before this version, there was no way to control who can create an application. In 1.17, users can restrict application creation by setting `fiat.restrictApplicationCreation` to `true`, and then providing `CREATE` permissions using a permission source (see above). Note that `CREATE` permissions provided by the front50 source of applications will be ignored. So currently, the way to provide `CREATE` permissions is using the prefix source explained above.
