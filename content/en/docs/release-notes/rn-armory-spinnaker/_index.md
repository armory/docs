## Different Armory Release Types

Armory is based off OSS's (Open Source Spinnaker) [release cadence](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/release-cadence), in which we extend OSS with Armory features. We provide a few different release types.

| Release Type | Description                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `stable`     | Stable release for use in production environments |
| `rc`         | Latest Armory + OSS release candidates            |
| `ossedge`    | OSS nightly builds (_untested_)                   |
| `edge`       | Armory nightly + OSS nightly builds (_untested_)  |


## Understanding Armory + Open Source Spinnaker Releases
### Stable Releases
```yml
$ hal version list
...
 - 2.2.0 (OSS Release 1.11.9):
   Changelog: https://docs.armory.io/release-notes/armoryspinnaker_v2.2.0/
   Published: Mon Feb 25 04:58:47 GMT 2019
   (Requires Halyard >= 1.2.0)
 - 2.3.0 (OSS Release 1.12.x):
   Changelog: https://docs.armory.io/release-notes/armoryspinnaker_v2.3.0/
   Published: Thu Mar 28 03:44:19 GMT 2019
   (Requires Halyard >= 1.2.0)
```
**Stable** releases have been tested by Armory. Most of our customers will be using them.

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for tagging, e.g. `12.3.4`.
- MAJOR versions correspond to any major Armory platform changes or breaking OSS changes.
- MINOR versions correspond to a new OSS release branch.
- PATCH versions are reserved for minor changes in the same OSS branch.

| Armory Release | OSS Release Branch |
| -------------- | -----------        |
| 2.1.x          | 1.10.x             |
| 2.2.x          | 1.11.x             |
| 2.3.x          | 1.12.x             |
| 2.4.x          | 1.13.x             |
| 2.5.x          | 1.14.x             |
| 2.15.x         | 1.15.x             |
| 2.16.x         | 1.16.x             |
| 2.17.x         | 1.17.x             |
| 2.18.x         | 1.18.x             |
| 2.19.x         | 1.19.x             |


### RC Releases
```yml
$ hal version list --release=rc
...
 - 2.2.1-rc463 (2.2.1 Release Candidate):
   Changelog: https://docs.armory.io/release-notes/armoryspinnaker_v2.2.1/
   Published: Mon Apr 01 16:53:32 GMT 2019
   (Requires Halyard >= 1.2.0)
 - 2.3.1-rc40 (2.3.1 Release Candidate):
   Changelog: https://docs.armory.io/release-notes/armoryspinnaker_v2.3.1/
   Published: Mon Apr 01 16:53:33 GMT 2019
   (Requires Halyard >= 1.2.0)
```
An **rc** release reflects the latest from Armory and OSS release branches.
- These versions are used internally at Armory.
- A few customers may be using it, but we do not recommend using it in production.

<!--
- A **next rc** will be created from OSS `1.10.*`
  + This version has not been tested at Armory, only built and served.
  + A few customers may be using it, but we do not recommend using it in production.
-->


**RC**s also follow semantic versioning with the format like `1.2.3-rc202`.


### OSS Edge Releases
```yml
$ hal version list --release=ossedge
...
 - 2019.04.03-ossedge2143 (OSS Edge release):
   Changelog: https://docs.armory.io/release-notes
   Published: Wed Apr 03 18:34:18 GMT 2019
   (Requires Halyard >= 1.2.0)
```
An **ossedge** release is created from OSS `master`.
- This version has not been tested at Armory, only built and served.
- This is mainly being used for development work by our customers and **should not be** used in production or any critical workloads.

Armory uses dates and build numbers for their versions. e.g.:
- `2019.04.03-ossedge2143`
- `2019.04.02-ossedge2142`
- `2019.04.01-ossedge2141`
- (Weekend! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’ƒ)
- `2019.03.29-ossedge2140`
- `2019.03.28-ossedge2139`
- `2019.03.27-ossedge2138`
- ...

### Edge Releases
```yml
bash-4.4$ hal version list --release=edge
....
 - 2018.11.01-edge1031 (Edge release):
   Changelog: https://docs.armory.io/release-notes
   Published: Thu Nov 01 20:10:29 GMT 2018
```
An **edge** release is created from OSS `master` and Armory `master`.
- These aren't actively maintained, but can be built when a customer has need for it.
- This is mainly being used for development work by our customers and **should not be** used in production or any critical workloads.

## Selecting a version to install
```yml
$ hal config version edit --version 2.3.0
```
