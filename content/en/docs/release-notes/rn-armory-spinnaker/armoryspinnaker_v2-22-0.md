#### Spinnaker metrics

Metrics data, specifically the metric names, for Spinnaker changed in 2.20. These changes are not backwards compatible and may result in broken third-party dashboards, such as Grafana dashboards.

**Workarounds**:

* **Observability plugin**: Armory is working on updates to the [Observability plugin](https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-observability-plugin) to remedy this issue. The plugin currently supports New Relic & Prometheus. Note that this resolution requires you to make updates to use the new metric names.

   For information about how to install a plugin, see [Plugin Users Guide](https://spinnaker.io/guides/user/plugins/).

* **Update existing dashboards**: Change your dashboards and alerts to use the new metric names.

Although both workarounds involve updating your dashboards to use the new metric names, Armory recommends switching to the Observability plugin. Due to changes the Spinnaker project is making, the Observability plugin provides a long-term solution. 

This release note will be updated once the updated plugin is available.

Summary of changes in the latest release.

#### Security fixes

This release includes fixes for the following CVEs:

* [CVE-2020-11984](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11984)
* [CVE-2020-9484](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484)

Additionally, several CVEs are resolved in the Deck and Gate services.

#### UI

The Spinnaker UI, Deck, has undergone extensive changes to provide better user experience around certain features. The changes may look drastic at first, but Fernando, an engineer at Armory, is here to walk you through them:

**New buttons**

When you first log in to Spinnaker, you now see **Create Application** and **Create Project** buttons. Previously, these were under a menu named **Actions**. The buttons also appear on the corresponding page, either Application or Project.

**Applications view**

The changes look drastic, but there is no change in functionality. The top navigation for the **Applications** page is now on the left and has been expanded so that more capabilities are visible at the top level.
