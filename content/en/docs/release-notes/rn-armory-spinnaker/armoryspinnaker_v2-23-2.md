### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue where Clouddriver consumed more threads than it needed, which led to situations where pods did not have enough resources to start.
- Fixed an issue where Slack notifications for Pipelines as Code (Dinghy) did not work.
- Fixed an issue where an old version of Deck, the Spinnaker UI, was included in the Armory release.

## Highlighted updates

<!--
Each item category (such as UI) under here should be an h3 (###). List the following info that service owners should be able to provide:
- Major changes or new features we want to call out for Armory and OSS. Changes should be grouped under end user understandable sections. For example, instead of Deck, use UI. Instead of Fiat, use Permissions.
- Fixes to any known issues from previous versions that we have in release notes. These can all be grouped under a Fixed issues H3.
-->

### Notifications

Armory now supports using Microsoft Teams for notifications. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams](https://spinnaker.io/setup/features/notifications/#microsoft-teams).
