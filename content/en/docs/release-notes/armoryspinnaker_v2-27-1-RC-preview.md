#### NullPointerException in Clouddriver

The following NPE occurs in the Clouddriver service:

```
Error creating bean with name 'kubesvcCredentialsLoader': Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.lang.NullPointerException
```

To resolve the issue, set the following property to `false` in your Operator manifest: `spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles.clouddriver.armory.cloud.enabled`.


## Highlighted updates

### Clound Foundry

* Improved the resiliency of the Cloud Foundry provider. Invalid permissions for a caching agent, such as if permissions are missing for one region, no longer cause all deployments to that account to fail.
* Improved the caching behavior for the provider. Previously, the cache on a dedicated caching pod (such as when cache sharding or HA is enabled) may not have been updated if a different pod performed an operation that modifies the cache. This led to situations where the Cloud Foundry provider to attempt actions for Server Groups that no longer existed. You can configure this behavior with the following properties in your Operator manifest:
   - `expireAfterWrite`: the amount of time (in seconds) to wait before expiring the cache after a write operation
   - `expireAfterAccess`: the amount of time (in seconds) to wait before expiring the cache after a access operation
* Improved error handling when a caching agent has insufficient permissions. A RuntimeException no longer occurs.

###  Spinnaker Community Contributions

There have also been numerous enhancements, fixes, and features across all of Spinnaker's other services. See the
[Spinnaker v1.27.0](https://www.spinnaker.io/changelogs/1.27.0-changelog/) changelog for details.
