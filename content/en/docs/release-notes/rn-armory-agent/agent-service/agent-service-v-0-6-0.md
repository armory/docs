## Breaking changes

* The configuration file for Agent has been renamed from `kubesvc.{yml|yaml}` to `armory-agent.{yml|yaml}`. Additionally, its location changed from `/opt/spinnaker/config` to `/opt/armory/config`. The old config file is still used if `armory-agent.{yml|yaml}` is not present, but users are encouraged to move to the new naming convention.
* Agent docker images are now published to `armory/agent-k8s` on Docker Hub. Previously, the images were published to `armory/kubesvc`.
