## DNS Preparation

We'll be setting up two CNAME entries in our DNS in this example; we won't be
able to actually configure the DNS until we get an A record from AWS after
creating the LoadBalancer, but we'll need to select the names in order to configure
the LoadBalancer.  For this tutorial, we've selected `demo.armory.io` to be
our Deck service (the UI), and `gate.demo.armory.io` to be our Gate service
(the API).

## Exposing Spinnaker on EKS with a public Load Balancer

### Create a LoadBalancer service

While there are many ways to expose Spinnaker, we find the method described in this post to be the easiest way to get started. If your organization has other requirements, this post may be helpful as you start working through the process.

**Operator**

Update your `SpinnakerService` manifest with the following example `expose` configuration, which will automatically create one Kubernetes service LoadBalancer for the API (Gate) and one for the UI (Deck):

```yaml
apiversion: spinnaker.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  ...  # rest of config omitted for brevity
  expose:
    type: service
    service:
      type: loadbalancer
```

Save and apply the configuration. After some time, you can see the LoadBalancer CNAMEs that were created:

```bash
NAMESPACE={spinnaker namespace}
API_URL=$(kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get spinsvc spinnaker -o jsonpath='{.status.apiUrl}')
UI_URL=$(kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get spinsvc spinnaker -o jsonpath='{.status.uiUrl}')
```

**Halyard**

First, we’ll start by creating LoadBalancer Services which will expose the API (Gate) and the UI (Deck) via a Load Balancer in your cloud provider. We’ll do this by running the commands below and creating the spin-gate-public and spin-deck-public Services.

`NAMESPACE` is the Kubernetes namespace where your Spinnaker install is located. Halyard defaults to spinnaker unless explicitly overridden.

> Note: If you want to secure each endpoint with SSL, change it to `443` and continue through the guide.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=spinnaker
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} expose service spin-gate --type LoadBalancer \
  --port 80,443 \
  --target-port 8084 \
  --name spin-gate-public

kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} expose service spin-deck --type LoadBalancer \
  --port 80,443 \
  --target-port 9000 \
  --name spin-deck-public
```

Once these Services have been created, we’ll need to update our Spinnaker deployment so that the UI understands where the API is located. To do this, we’ll use Halyard to override the base URL for both the API and the UI and then redeploy Spinnaker.

```bash
# use the newly created LBs
export NAMESPACE={namespace}
export API_URL=$(kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get svc spin-gate-public -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
export UI_URL=$(kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get svc spin-deck-public -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')

# or use DNS records
# export API_URL=spinnaker-gate.armory.io
# export UI_URL=spinnaker.armory.io

# Note, we're not using SSL yet, later in the guide we will.
hal config security api edit --override-base-url http://${API_URL}
hal config security ui edit --override-base-url http://${UI_URL}
hal deploy apply
```

If you have a DNS in mind, set it up like the following example:
```bash
spinnaker-gate.armory.io CNAME --> (spin-gate-public dns) aaaaa-1111.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
spinnaker.armory.io      CNAME --> (spin-deck-public dns) aaaaa-2222.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
```

### Secure with SSL on EKS

This tutorial presumes you've already created a certificate in the AWS Certificate Manager.

**Operator**

Update and apply the `SpinnakerService` manifest to specify the DNS names for Gate and Deck, and to provide annotations specific for EKS LoadBalancers:

```yaml
apiversion: spinnaker.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    config:
      security:
        apiSecurity:
          overrideBaseUrl: https://spinnaker-gate.armory.io  # Specify your DNS name for Gate with https scheme
        uiSecurity:
          overrideBaseUrl: https://spinnaker.armory.io       # Specify your DNS name for Deck with https scheme
        ...  # rest of config omitted for brevity
  expose:
    type: service
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: http
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: <ACM CERT ARN>  # Replace with your cert ARN
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: 80,443
```

Assuming that Spinnaker is installed in `spinnaker` namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker apply -f spinnakerservice.yml
```

**Halyard**

> Note: If you created the services with port 8084 and 9000, you will need to edit them to make SSL work. To do so, run `kubectl -n spinnaker edit service spin-gate-public` and `kubectl -n spinnaker edit service spin-deck-public`. Change the public port to 443.

First get the certificate arn and run
```bash
export ACM_CERT_ARN="arn:::::your:cert"
```

Edit the LoadBalancer service `spin-gate-public` and  `spin-deck-public` we will include 3 annotations for each.

```bash
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} annotate svc spin-gate-public service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol=http
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} annotate svc spin-gate-public service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert=${ACM_CERT_ARN}
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} annotate svc spin-gate-public service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports=80,443

kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} annotate svc spin-deck-public service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol=http
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} annotate svc spin-deck-public service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert=${ACM_CERT_ARN}
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} annotate svc spin-deck-public service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports=80,443
```

We’ll need to update the internal URLs (Deck will complain about trying to call out to an HTTP resource from an HTTPS request). Update the URLs like we did before, but changing the protocols to https:

```bash
hal config security api edit --override-base-url https://gate.demo.armory.io
hal config security ui edit --override-base-url https://demo.armory.io
hal deploy apply
```

### Enabling sticky sessions

If your Armory installation will be using authentication and you expect to scale the API server (Gate) beyond more than one instance you'll want to enable sticky sessions. This will ensure that clients will connect and authenticate with the same server each time. Otherwise, you may be forced to reauthenticate if you get directed to a new server. To enable sticky sessions, you'll want to enable session affinity on the Gate service created above.

```bash
GATE_SVC=<spin-gate/spin-gate-public>  # spin-gate if using Spinnaker Operator, spin-gate-public if using Halyard
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} patch service/$GATE_SVC --patch '{"spec": {"sessionAffinity": "ClientIP"}}'
```

For more details about session affinity, see the Kubernetes documentation on [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

## Exposing Spinnaker on EKS with an internal Load balancer

In this option the goal is to use AWS ALB's of type `internal` for exposing Spinnaker only within an organization's private VPC. This consists of 3 steps: configuring Kubernetes services of type `NodePort`, creating AWS internal ALB's and updating Spinnaker with final DNS names.

### Step 1: Create Kubernetes NodePort services

A `NodePort` Kubernetes service opens the same port (automatically chosen) on all EKS worker nodes, and forwards requests to internal pods. In this case we'll be creating two services: one for Deck (Spinnaker's UI) and one for Gate (Spinnaker's API).

**Operator**

```yaml
apiversion: spinnaker.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  ...  # rest of config omitted for brevity
  expose:
    type: service
    service:
      type: NodePort
      ...  # rest of config omitted for brevity
```

Assuming that Spinnaker is installed in `spinnaker` namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker apply -f spinnakerservice.yml
```

After a few seconds you can view which ports were opened in EKS worker nodes, you'll need them in the next step:

```bash
DECK_PORT=$(kubectl get service spin-deck -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
GATE_PORT=$(kubectl get service spin-gate -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
```

**Halyard**

Replace the namespace by the one where spinnaker is installed:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=spinnaker
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} expose service spin-gate --type NodePort \
  --port 8084 \
  --target-port 8084 \
  --name spin-gate-nodeport

kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} expose service spin-deck --type NodePort \
  --port 9000 \
  --target-port 9000 \
  --name spin-deck-nodeport
```

After a few seconds you can view which ports were opened in EKS worker nodes, you'll need them in the next step:

```bash
DECK_PORT=$(kubectl get service spin-deck-nodeport -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
GATE_PORT=$(kubectl get service spin-gate-nodeport -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
```

### Step 2: Create AWS internal load balancers

We'll describe how to create these load balancers from AWS console, but you can use any preferred method for provisioning infrastructure. We'll create a Load Balancer for Deck and other for Gate.

Navigate to AWS EC2 management console, in `Load Balancers` section, and click on `Create New Load Balancer`

![image](/images/configure_ingress_new_lb.png)

We'll be creating a new Application Load Balancer:

![image](/images/configure_ingress_create_alb.png)

Make sure to select `internal` scheme, and if you have a SSL certificate available, use `HTTPS` protocol:

![image](/images/configure_ingress_alb_1.png)

Select the VPC and subnets where EKS worker nodes live:

![image](/images/configure_ingress_alb_2.png)

If you selected `HTTPS` for the protocol, you can configure here the ACM certificate:

![image](/images/configure_ingress_alb_ssl.png)

In the next screen you can either select an existing security group or create a new one for your load balancer:

![image](/images/configure_ingress_sg.png)

Now you want to create a new target group that points to `DECK_PORT` or `GATE_PORT`, taken from the NodePort created in the previous step:

![image](/images/configure_ingress_tg.png)

Finally, you need to select all EKS worker nodes to be registered with the load balancer target, review and save the changes:

![image](/images/configure_ingress_register_targets.png)

If for some reason you get `Unhealthy` status in the target group you created, make sure that EKS worker nodes security groups allow traffic to the target ports, at least from Load Balancer's security groups.

Finally repeat the same steps for creating Gate Load balancer.

### Step 3: Update Spinnaker configuration

Spinnaker needs to know which url's are used to access it. After you have updated your DNS with the Load Balancers CNAME's created in the previous step, the next step is to update Spinnaker configuration:

**Operator**

Update and apply the `SpinnakerService` manifest:

```yaml
apiversion: spinnaker.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    config:
      security:
        apiSecurity:
          overrideBaseUrl: https://spinnaker-gate.armory.io  # Specify your DNS name for Gate with https scheme
        uiSecurity:
          overrideBaseUrl: https://spinnaker.armory.io       # Specify your DNS name for Deck with https scheme
          ...  # rest of config omitted for brevity
```

Assuming that Spinnaker is installed in `spinnaker` namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker apply -f spinnakerservice.yml
```


Halyard

```bash
hal config security api edit --override-base-url https://${GATE_DNS_NAME}
hal config security ui edit --override-base-url https://${DECK_DNS_NAME}
hal deploy apply
```


## Exposing Spinnaker on GKE with Ingress
### Setting up HTTP Load Balancing with Ingress

GKE has a “built-in” ingress controller and that's what we will use.

First create a file called basic-ingress.yaml and paste it the following

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: basic-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: demo.armory.io
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: spin-deck
          servicePort: 80  # Port 80 if using Operator, port 9000 if using Halyard
        path: /
  - host: gate.demo.armory.io
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: spin-gate
          servicePort: 80  # Port 80 if using Operator, port 8084 if using Halyard
        path: /
```

Then apply this
`kubectl apply -f basic-ingress.yaml`

Find out the external IP address of the load balancer serving your application by running:
`kubectl get ingress basic-ingress`


Output:

```
NAME            HOSTS                                       ADDRESS         PORTS     AGE
basic-ingress   demo.armory.io, gate.demo.armory.io         203.0.113.12    80        2m
```

Note: It may take a few minutes for GKE to allocate an external IP address and set up forwarding rules until the load balancer is ready to serve your application. In the meanwhile, you may get errors such as HTTP 404 or HTTP 500 until the load balancer configuration is propagated across the globe.

You need to update your DNS records to have the demo.armory.io host point to the IP address generated.

Now tell Spinnaker about its external endpoints:

**Operator**

Update and apply the `SpinnakerService` manifest:

```yaml
apiversion: spinnaker.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    config:
      security:
        apiSecurity:
          overrideBaseUrl: http://gate.demo.armory.io  # Specify your DNS name for Gate
        uiSecurity:
          overrideBaseUrl: http://demo.armory.io       # Specify your DNS name for Deck
          ...  # rest of config omitted for brevity
```

Assuming that Spinnaker is installed in `spinnaker` namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker apply -f spinnakerservice.yml
```

**Halyard**

```bash
hal config security api edit --override-base-url https://gate.demo.armory.io
hal config security ui edit --override-base-url https://demo.armory.io
hal deploy apply
```

After doing that you can visit http://demo.armory.io/ to view spinnaker.

### Secure with SSL on GKE
To enable SSL and configure your certificates you can follow this guide:
[https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ingress-multi-ssl](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ingress-multi-ssl)

## HTTP/HTTPS Redirects

You must enable HTTP/HTTPS redirects when your Spinnaker deployment fits the following description:
* TLS encryption for Deck (UI) and Gate (API) for Spinnaker
* A load balancer (service, ingress, etc.) in front of your Deck/Gate that terminates TLS and forwards communications to the Spinnaker microservices.

To enable redirects, complete the following steps:

**Operator**

Update the `SpinnakerService` manifest with the following:

```yaml
apiversion: spinnaker.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      gate:
        server:
          tomcat:
            protocolHeader: X-Forwarded-Proto
            remoteIpHeader: X-Forwarded-For
            internalProxies: .*
            httpsServerPort: X-Forwarded-Port
            ...  # rest of config omitted for brevity
```

Assuming that Spinnaker is installed in `spinnaker` namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker apply -f spinnakerservice.yml
```

Finally, clear your cache.

**Halyard**

Add the following entry to your `.hal/<deployment-name>/profiles/gate-local.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  tomcat:
    protocolHeader: X-Forwarded-Proto
    remoteIpHeader: X-Forwarded-For
    internalProxies: .*
    httpsServerPort: X-Forwarded-Port
```
Next, run the following command: `hal deploy apply`.

Finally, clear your cache.

For an alternative solution, see the following Knowledge Base article: [Troubleshooting http/https redirects with authentication](https://kb.armory.io/troubleshooting/https-redirects/).
