title: Policy Engine for Armory Enterprise
linkTitle: Policy Engine
description: >
  Enable the Policy Engine to enforce policies on your Armory Enterprise instance. Policies can help you make sure that best practices are followed by preventing pipelines from being saved or running if they do not meet requirements that you outline. This page includes how to deploy and configure an OPA server, which the Policy Engine requires.

## Overview

The Armory Policy Engin is a proprietary feature for Armory Enterprise that is designed to allow you more complete control over the software delivery process. The Policy Engine provides the hooks necessary to perform  extensive verification of pipelines and processes in Armory Enterprise. The Policy Engine uses the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)(OPA) and input style documents to perform validations on the following:

* **Save time validation** - Validate pipelines as they're created or modified. 
* **Runtime validation** - Validate deployments as a pipeline is executing. This validation only operates on tasks that you have explicitly created policies for. Tasks with no policies are not validated.
* **Entitlements using API Authorization** - Control what actions can be taken based on a user's role. (Requires the Policy Engine plugin.)

> If no policies are configured for these policy checks, all actions are allowed.

The Policy Engine exists as a plugin, which is its newer iteration, and as an extension of Armory Enterprise. The plugin has additional features that are not present in the extension. If you are getting started with the Policy Engine, Armory recommends using the plugin version of the Policy Engine. If you want to migrate from the extension to the plugin, see [Migrating to the Policy Engine Plugin](#migrating-to-the-policy-engine-plugin).

For information about how to use the Policy Engine, see [Using the Policy Engine]({{< ref "policy-engine-use" >}}).

## Requirements for using the Policy Engine

Make sure you can meet the following version requirements for the Policy Engine:

* OPA versions 0.12.x or later. Specifically, the OPA v1 API must be available.
* A supported version of Armory Enterprise


## Before You Start

The Policy Engine requires an OPA server. You can either use the example on this page to deploy a server in the same Kubernetes cluster as Armory Enterprise or see the OPA documentation for information about how to [deploy an OPA server](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa).

### Deploy an OPA server

The Policy Engine supports the following OPA server deployments:

* An OPA server deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster as an Armory Spinnaker deployment. The [Using ConfigMaps for OPA policies](#using-configmaps-for-opa-policies) section contains a ConfigMap you can use.
* An OPA cluster that is **not** in the same Kubernetes cluster as an Armory Spinnaker deployment . See the [OPA documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) for more information about installing an OPA server in a separate cluster.

#### Using ConfigMaps for OPA Policies

If you want to use ConfigMaps for OPA policies, you can use the below manifest as a starting point. This example manifest deploys an OPA server and applies the configuration for things like rolebinding and a static DNS.
When using the below example, keep the following guidelines in mind:
* The manifest does not configure any authorization requirements for the OPA server it deploys. This means that anyone can add a policy.
* The manifest deploys the OPA server to a namespace called `opa`.
* The OPA server uses the following config: `"--require-policy-label=true"`. This configures the OPA server to look for a specific label so that it does not check all configmaps for new policies. For information about how to apply the relevant label to your policy configmaps, see [Creating a policy]({{< ref "policy-engine-use#step-2-add-the-policy-to-your-opa-server" >}}).

## Enabling the Policy Engine

Armory recommends using the [plugin]({{< ref "policy-engine-plug-enable.md" >}}). To migrate to the plugin from the extension, see [Migrating to the Policy Engine Plugin](#migrating-to-the-policy-engine-plugin). For information about making configuration changes to a Policy Engine Extension instance that already exists, see the [extension page]({{< ref "policy-engine-ext-enable.md" >}}).

## Migrating to the Policy Engine Plugin

To migrate to the Policy Engine Plugin from the extension, perform the following steps:

1. Turn off the Policy Engine extension. You cannot run both the extension and plugin at the same time. You must disable the extension project and then enable the plugin.
   * **Halyard**: Remove the following snippet from `.hal/default/profiles/spinnaker-local.yml`:
   ```yaml
   armory:
     opa:
       enabled: true
       url: <OPA Server URL>:<port>/v1
   ```
   * **Operator**:  Remove the `opa` blocks from the Front50 and Clouddriver sections of your `SpinnakerService` manifest:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
   kind: SpinnakerService
   metadata:
     name: spinnaker
   spec:
     spinnakerConfig:
       profiles:
         front50: #Enables Save time validation of policies
           armory:
             opa:
               enabled: true
               url: <OPA Server URL>:<port>/v1
         clouddriver: #Enables Runtime validation of policies
           armory:
             opa:
               enabled: true
               url: <OPA Server URL>:<port>/v1
   ```

   > If you redeploy Armory Enterprise and apply these changes before you enable the Policy Engine Plugin, no policies get enforced.

2. Enable the [Policy Engine Plugin]({{< ref "policy-engine-plug-enable" >}}).  If you have an existing OPA server with policies that you want to use, you can provide that OPA server in the plugin configuration. You do not need to create a new OPA server or migrate your policies.
