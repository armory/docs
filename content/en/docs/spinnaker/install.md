## Installing Armory Spinnaker for Small Teams and POCs

Armory Minnaker is an easy to use installation script that leverages the power of **Kubernetes** with the simplicity of a _Virtual Machine_.  The Kubernetes environmnent that will get installed on your behalf is based on [Rancher's K3s](https://k3s.io/).  You do not need to know how to setup Kubernetes as we have done all of the hard parts for you allowing you to get up and running with Spinnaker in under 10 minutes.  Check out [our video](https://youtu.be/jg8vJEzcuAA) on running Spinnaker across all of the public clouds including VMWare Fusion locally.  This deployment makes it easy to get up and running today and let's you scale your deployment into a medium to large deployment down the road.

### Prerequisites

Your VM should have 4 vCPUs, 16G of memory and 30G of HDD space.

### Getting Started

Check out the [GitHub project](https://github.com/armory/minnaker) for more information. After you install Minnaker, use the [AWS Quick Start]({{< ref "Armory-Spinnaker-Quickstart-1" >}}) to learn how to configure Spinnaker to deploy to AWS.

## Installing Armory Spinnaker for Medium to Large Enterprise Deployments

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a kubernetes cluster with a minimum of **15 GB** of memory and **8 CPU's** total _available_ to be used by Spinnaker. At least a single node should have 4 GB and 1 CPU available.

### Install Armory Halyard

Install Armory's version of Halyard in a Docker container or Kubernetes cluster in order
to run Halyard and its command line interface.

See also [Armory Halyard configuration]({{< ref "configure-halyard" >}}).

#### Run Armory Halyard in Docker

##### Before You Start

The Docker image will contain most of the files you will need.  However,
you may need to update your `.kube/config` file to use
`heptio-authenticator-aws` instead of `aws-iam-authenticator`; although
both are compatible, the Docker container expects to use the former.

If the `.hal` directory you map in the docker command below
already exist, make sure you have write permission to that directory
(and read permissions to the others).  If the directory doesn't exist,
it will be created by the docker container.

Our installer currently expects to find your kubeconfig named `config` in
the `.kube` directory you map below.  If you've named your config something
else, you'll need to rename or symlink the file accordingly.

##### Running Armory Halyard in Docker

You can start Armory Halyard in a Docker container with the following command:

```
docker run --name armory-halyard --rm \
    -v ~/.hal:/home/spinnaker/.hal \
    -v ~/.kube:/home/spinnaker/.kube \
    -v ~/.aws:/home/spinnaker/.aws \
    -it docker.io/armory/halyard-armory:{{< param halyard-armory-version >}}
```

> Note: If you're installing to Google Cloud, you'll want to change the
> ".aws" mapping above to your Google credentials json file, and then
> you'll need to set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
> within the shell so the installer can find it.

Once Armory Halyard is running, you can interact with it by opening a separate
Terminal and running:

```
docker exec -it armory-halyard bash
```

From there, you can issue all your [halyard commands](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/).

#### Run Armory Halyard in Kubernetes
You can start Armory Halyard in a pod with the following manifest:
```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: halconfig-pvc
  labels:
    app: halyard
  namespace: halyard
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: halyard
  namespace: halyard
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: halyard
  serviceName: halyard
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: halyard
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: halyard
        image: index.docker.io/armory/halyard-armory:{{< param halyard-armory-version >}}
        volumeMounts:
        - name: halconfig
          mountPath: /home/spinnaker/
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 65533
      volumes:
      - name: halconfig
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: halconfig-pvc
```

Copy and paste the manifest into a file named halyard.yml, then deploy the above manifest (halyard.yml) into Kubernetes with the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f halyard.yml
```
> Note: This installs Halyard into the namespace 'halyard'

Once the pod is deployed - you can interact with it by running:
```
kubectl -n halyard exec -ti halyard-xxxxx bash  # make sure you get the exact pod name
```

### Install Armory Spinnaker

With Armory's version of Halyard installed, you can interact with Armory Spinnaker with the exact same
commands used to interact with Open Source Halyard.  The key differences between Armory and
OSS are as follows:

* Armory Halyard installs Armory Spinnaker instead of Open Source Spinnaker
* Armory Spinnaker version numbers are one major version ahead of Open Source Spinnaker. For example, Armory Spinnaker 2.18 maps toOpen Source Spinnaker version 1.18.
* Armory Halyard has several additional capabilities, primarily centered on Armory-specific features, including Terraform integration, Pipelines as Code, and Vault integration.

To install Armory Spinnaker, you use the same `hal` commands as Open Source Spinnaker.  Here are some guides on how to install Spinnaker based on your environment:

* [Install Armory Spinnaker on K8s]({{< ref "install-on-k8s" >}})
* [Install Armory Spinnanker on AKS]({{< ref "install-on-aks" >}})
* [Install Armory Spinnaker on AWS]({{< ref "install-on-aws" >}})
* [Install Armory Spinnaker from the AWS Container Marketplace]({{< ref "aws-container-marketplace" >}})
* [Install Armory Spinnaker on GKE]({{< ref "install-on-gke" >}})

##### Notes on Docker

You will not be able to access the proxy in the Docker container from your
machine directly, so you'll need to install kubectl natively on your system
and then run the following two commands:

```bash
SPINNAKER_NAMESPACE=YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE
kubectl -n ${SPINNAKER_NAMESPACE} port-forward services/spin-deck 9000:9000 &
kubectl -n ${SPINNAKER_NAMESPACE} port-forward services/spin-gate 8084:8084 &
```

You should then be able to connect to http://localhost:9000/ with your
browser and use your newly installed Spinnaker.
