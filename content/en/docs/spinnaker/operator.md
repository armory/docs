## Overview

Spinnaker Operator is a Kubernetes operator for Spinnaker that makes it easier to install, deploy, and upgrade any version of Spinnaker through a workflow that you are already familiar with.  There are two flavors of the Spinnaker Operator:

* The open source [Spinnaker Operator](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator) that installs open source Spinnaker.
* The proprietary Armory Spinnaker Operator that installs Armory Spinnaker. This version comes with additional enterprise features.

After you install Spinnaker Operator, you can use `kubectl` to manage the lifecycle of your deployment.

Operator has two distinct modes you can install and use:

- **Basic**: Operator in basic mode installs Spinnaker into a single namespace without `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` for doing preflight checks.
- **Cluster**: Operator in cluster mode installs Spinnaker across namespaces with `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` for doing preflight checks. This mode requires a `ClusterRole`.

If you want to get started quickly, install Operator and Spinnaker by running the following commands:

```
# Pick a release from https://github.com/armory-io/spinnaker-operator/releases
mkdir -p spinnaker-operator && cd spinnaker-operator
bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/armory-io/spinnaker-operator/releases/latest/download/manifests.tgz | tar -xz'

# Install or update CRDs cluster wide
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/

# Install Operator in namespace spinnaker-operator. If you want a different namespace, see the below documentaiton.
kubectl create ns spinnaker-operator
kubectl -n spinnaker-operator apply -f deploy/operator/cluster

# Install Spinnaker in the "spinnaker" namespace
kubectl create ns spinnaker
kubectl -n spinnaker apply -f deploy/spinnaker/basic

# Watch the install progress and check out the pods being created too!
kubectl -n spinnaker get spinsvc spinnaker -w
```

The rest of this page describes how to modify some of the default configurations within Operator to suit your needs.

## Benefits of Operator

- Stop using Halyard commands: just `kubectl apply` your Spinnaker configuration. This includes support for local files.
- Expose Spinnaker to the outside world (with `LoadBalancer`). You can still disable that behavior if you prefer to manage ingresses and load balancers yourself.
- Deploy any version of Spinnaker. Operator is not tied to a particular version of Spinnaker.
- Keep secrets separate from your config. Store your config in `git` and have an easy Gitops workflow.
- Validate your configuration before applying it (with webhook validation).
- Store Spinnaker secrets in [Kubernetes secrets](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator/blob/release-0.3.x/doc/managing-spinnaker.md#secrets-in-kubernetes-secrets).
- Patch versions, accounts or any setting with `kustomize`.
- Monitor the health of Spinnaker via `kubectl`.
- Define Kubernetes accounts in `SpinnakerAccount` objects and store kubeconfig inline, in Kubernetes secrets, in s3, or GCS **(Experimental)**.

## Operator Requirements

Before you start, ensure the following requirements are met:

- Your Kubernetes cluster runs version 1.13 or later.
- You have admission controllers enabled in Kubernetes (`-enable-admission-plugins`).
- You have `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` enabled in the kube-apiserver. Alternatively, you can pass the `--disable-admission-controller` parameter to the to the `deployment.yaml` file that deploys the operator.
- You have admin rights to install the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for Operator.

## Accounts CRD (Experimental)

Operator introduces a new CRD for Spinnaker accounts. `SpinnakerAccount` is defined in an object - separate from the main Spinnaker config - so its creation and maintenance can easily be automated.

To read more about this CRD, see [SpinnakerAccount](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator/blob/master/doc/spinnaker-accounts.md).

## Install Operator

### Download the Operator Manifests

Download CRDs and example manifests from the [latest stable release](https://github.com/armory-io/spinnaker-operator/releases).

```bash
# For a stable release (https://github.com/armory-io/spinnaker-operator/releases)
mkdir -p spinnaker-operator && cd spinnaker-operator
bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/armory-io/spinnaker-operator/releases/latest/download/manifests.tgz | tar -xz'
```

For both Basic and Cluster modes, you must download and apply the SpinnakerService CRD.
Note that you must have admin rights to install the CRD.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/
```

**Note**: To install OSS Spinnaker, use [https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator) instead.


### Installing Operator in Basic Mode
To install Operator in basic mode, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -n <op_namespace> -f deploy/operator/basic
```

`<op_namespace>` is the namespace where you want the operator to live. To monitor installation, run the following command:

```
# Watch the install progress. Check out the pods being created too!
kubectl -n spinnaker get spinsvc spinnaker -w
```

After installation, you can verify that the Operator is running with the following command:
```bash
kubectl -n <op_namespace> get pods
```

The command returns output similar to the following if the pod for the Operator is running:

```
NAMESPACE                             READY         STATUS       RESTARTS      AGE
spinnaker-operator-7cd659654b-4vktl   2/2           Running      0             6s
```

## Installing Operator in Cluster Mode
To install Operator for cluster mode, perform the following steps:

1. Decide which namespace you want Operator to live in and then create the namespace. Armory recommends `spinnaker-operator`.
2. If you want to use a namespace other than `spinnaker-operator`, edit `deploy/operator/cluster/role_binding.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   kind: ClusterRoleBinding
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: spinnaker-operator-binding
   subjects:
   - kind: ServiceAccount
     name: spinnaker-operator
     namespace: spinnaker-operator # Edit this value if you want Operator to live in a different namespace.
   roleRef:
     kind: ClusterRole
     name: spinnaker-operator-role
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   ```

    Then, save the changes to `role_binding.yaml`.

3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -n <op_namespace> -f deploy/operator/cluster
   ```

   `<op_namespace>` is the namespace where you want the operator to live. By default, this namespace is `spinnaker-operator`, so you would run the following command:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -n spinnaker-operator -f deploy/operator/cluster
   ```

After installation, you can verify that the Operator is running with the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n <op_namespace> get pods
```
The command returns output similar to the following if the pod for the Operator is running:

```
NAMESPACE                                READY         STATUS       RESTARTS      AGE
spinnaker-operator-7cd659654b-4vktl      2/2           Running      0             6s
```

## Installing Spinnaker Using Operator

Once you install the CRDs and Operator, check out the examples in `deploy/spinnaker/`. To use the examples, change the parameters you need (especially the `persistentStorage` section). To install a basic version of Spinnaker with Operator, run the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl create ns <spinnaker-namespace>
$ kubectl -n <spinnaker-namespace> apply -f deploy/spinnaker/basic/SpinnakerService.yml
```
In the examples, the `spinnaker-namespace` parameter refers to the namespace where you want to install Spinnaker. It is likely different from Operator's namespace.

**Important**: You must edit `deploy/spinnaker/basic/SpinnakerService.yml` to point to persistent storage, such as an S3 bucket. Other attributes can also be changed. For example, if you change the value of the `version` field to `2.16.0`, Operator installs version 2.16.0.

You can read a detailed description of the SpinnakerService CRD in the [Spinnaker Operator Config]({{< ref "operator-config" >}}).


## Install Spinnaker with Operator and Kustomize

Operator supports Kustomize, a templating engine for Kubernetes. Using Kustomize along with Operator helps you create consistent, repeatable deployments of Spinnaker.

1. Edit `deploy/spinnaker/kustomize/kustomization.yml`.
2. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   kubectl create ns <spinnaker-namespace>
   kustomize build deploy/spinnaker/kustomize | kubectl -n <spinnaker-namespace> apply -f -
   ```
   `<spinnaker-namespace>` is the `namespace` where you want to deploy Spinnaker.

## Upgrading Spinnaker Using Operator

To upgrade an existing Spinnaker deployment using the Operator, perform the following steps:

1. Change the `version` field in `/deploy/spinnaker/basic/SpinnakerService.yml`  file to the target version for the upgrade.
2. Apply the updated manifest:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <spinnaker-namespace> apply -f deploy/spinnaker/basic/SpinnakerService.yml
   ```

   Replace `<spinnaker-namespace>` with the namespace for the existing Spinnaker deployment.

   You can view the upgraded services starting up with the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <spinnaker-namespace> describe spinsvc spinnaker
   ```

3. Verify the upgraded version of Spinnaker:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <spinnaker-namespace> get spinsvc
   ```

   The command returns information similar to the following:

   ```
   NAME         VERSION
   spinnaker    2.15.3
   ```

   `VERSION` should reflect the target version for your upgrade.

   Once the upgrade is complete, you can view information related to your Spinnaker deployment with the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <spinnaker-namespace> get svc
   ```

   The command returns information about the running Spinnaker services.


## Managing Spinnaker Using Operator

Operator allows you to use `kubectl` to manager you Spinnaker deployment.

**Listing Spinnaker Instances**

```bash
kubectl get spinnakerservice --all-namespaces
```

The short name `spinsvc` is also available.

**Describing Spinnaker Instances**

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> describe spinnakerservice spinnaker
```


**Deleting Spinnaker Instances**

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> delete spinnakerservice spinnaker
```

## Migrating from Halyard to Operator

If you have a current Spinnaker instance installed with Halyard, use this guide
to migrate existing configuration to Operator.

The migration process from Halyard to Operator can be completed in 7 steps:

1. To get started, install Spinnaker Operator.
2. Export Spinnaker configuration.

    Copy the desired profile's content from the `config` file

   For example, if you want to migrate the `default` hal profile, use the following `SpinnakerService` manifest structure:

   ```yaml
   currentDeployment: default
   deploymentConfigurations:
   - name: default
     <CONTENT>
   ```

   Add `<CONTENT>` in the `spec.spinnakerConfig.config` section in the `SpinnakerService` manifest as follows:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     spinnakerConfig:
       config:
         <<CONTENT>>
   ```

   Note: `config` is under `~/.hal`

   More details on [SpinnakerService Options]({{< ref "operator-config#specspinnakerconfig" >}}) on `.spec.spinnakerConfig.config` section

3. Export Spinnaker profiles.

   If you have configured Spinnaker profiles, you will need to migrate these profiles to the `SpinnakerService` manifest.

   First, identify the current profiles under  `~/.hal/default/profiles`

   For each file, create an entry under `spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles`

   For example, you have the following profile:

   ```bash
   $ ls -a ~/.hal/default/profiles | sort
   echo-local.yml
   ```

   Create a new entry with the name of the file without `-local.yaml` as follows:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     spinnakerConfig:
       profiles:
         echo:
           <CONTENT>
   ```

   More details on [SpinnakerService Options]({{< ref "operator-config#specspinnakerconfigprofiles" >}}) in the `.spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles` section

4. Export Spinnaker settings.

   If you configured Spinnaker settings, you need to migrate these settings to the `SpinnakerService` manifest also.

   First, identify the current settings under  `~/.hal/default/service-settings`

   For each file, create an entry under `spec.spinnakerConfig.service-settings`

   For example, you have the following settings:

   ```bash
   $ ls -a ~/.hal/default/service-settings | sort
   echo.yml
   ```

   Create a new entry with the name of the file without `.yaml` as follows:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     spinnakerConfig:
       service-settings:
         echo:
           <CONTENT>
   ```
   More details on [SpinnakerService Options]({{< ref "operator-config#specspinnakerconfigservice-settings" >}}) on `.spec.spinnakerConfig.service-settings` section

5. Export local file references.

   If you have references to local files in any part of the config, like `kubeconfigFile`, service account json files or others, you need to migrate these files to the `SpinnakerService` manifest.

   For each file, create an entry under `spec.spinnakerConfig.files`

   For example, you have a Kubernetes account configured like this:

   ```yaml
   kubernetes:
     enabled: true
     accounts:
     - name: prod
       requiredGroupMembership: []
       providerVersion: V2
       permissions: {}
       dockerRegistries: []
       configureImagePullSecrets: true
       cacheThreads: 1
       namespaces: []
       omitNamespaces: []
       kinds: []
       omitKinds: []
       customResources: []
       cachingPolicies: []
       oAuthScopes: []
       onlySpinnakerManaged: false
       kubeconfigFile: /home/spinnaker/.hal/secrets/kubeconfig-prod
     primaryAccount: prod
   ```

   The `kubeconfigFile` field is a reference to a physical file on the machine running Halyard. You need to create a new entry in `files` section like this:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     spinnakerConfig:
       files:
         kubeconfig-prod: |
           <CONTENT>
   ```

   Then replace the file path in the config to match the key in the `files` section:

   ```yaml
   kubernetes:
     enabled: true
     accounts:
     - name: prod
       requiredGroupMembership: []
       providerVersion: V2
       permissions: {}
       dockerRegistries: []
       configureImagePullSecrets: true
       cacheThreads: 1
       namespaces: []
       omitNamespaces: []
       kinds: []
       omitKinds: []
       customResources: []
       cachingPolicies: []
       oAuthScopes: []
       onlySpinnakerManaged: false
       kubeconfigFile: kubeconfig-prod  # File name must match "files" key
     primaryAccount: prod
   ```

   More details on [SpinnakerService Options]({{< ref "operator-config#specspinnakerconfigfiles" >}}) on `.spec.spinnakerConfig.files` section

6. Export Packer template files (if used).

   If you are using custom Packer templates for baking images, you need to migrate these files to the `SpinnakerService` manifest.

   First, identify the current templates under  `~/.hal/default/profiles/rosco/packer`

   For each file, reate an entry under `spec.spinnakerConfig.files`

   For example, you have the following `example-packer-config` file:

   ```bash
   $ tree -v ~/.hal/default/profiles
   ├── echo-local.yml
   └── rosco
       └── packer
           └── example-packer-config.json

   2 directories, 2 files
   ```

   You need to create a new entry with the name of the file following these instructions:

   - For each file, list the folder name starting with `profiles`, followed by double underscores (`__`) and at the very end the name of the file.

   ```yaml
   spec:
     spinnakerConfig:
       files:
         profiles__rosco__packer__example-packer-config.json: |
           <CONTENT>
   ```

   More details on [SpinnakerService Options]({{< ref "operator-config#specspinnakerconfigfiles" >}}) on `.spec.spinnakerConfig.files` section

6. Validate your Spinnaker configuration if you plan to run the Operator in cluster mode.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f <spinnaker service manifest> --server-dry-run
   ```

   The validation service throws an error when something is wrong with your manifest.

7. Apply your SpinnakerService:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f <spinnaker service>
   ```

## Custom Halyard Configuration

To override Halyard's configuration, create a `ConfigMap` with the configuration changes you need. For example, if using [secrets management with Vault]({{< ref "secrets-vault" >}}), Halyard and Operator containers will need your Vault configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: halyard-custom-config
data:
  halyard-local.yml: |
    secrets:
      vault:
        enabled: true
        url: <URL of vault server>
        path: <cluster path>
        role: <k8s role>
        authMethod: KUBERNETES
```

You can then mount it in the operator deployment and make it available to the Halyard and Operator containers:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spinnaker-operator
  ...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: spinnaker-operator
        ...
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /opt/spinnaker/config/halyard.yml
          name: halconfig-volume
          subPath: halyard-local.yml
      - name: halyard
        ...
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /opt/spinnaker/config/halyard-local.yml
          name: halconfig-volume
          subPath: halyard-local.yml
      volumes:
      - configMap:
          defaultMode: 420
          name: halyard-custom-config
        name: halconfig-volume
```

## Uninstalling Operator

Uninstalling the operator involves deleting its deployment and `SpinnakerService` CRD. When you delete the CRD, any Spinnaker installation created by Operator will also be deleted. This occurs because the CRD is set as the owner of the Spinnaker resources, so they get garbage collected.

There are two ways in which you can remove this ownership relationship. so that Spinnaker is not deleted when deleting the operator: [replacing Operator with Halyard](#replacing-operator-with-halyard) or [removing Operator ownership of Spinnaker resources](#removing-operator-ownership-from-spinnaker-resources).

### Replacing Operator with Halyard

First, export Spinnaker configuration settings to a format that Halyard understands:
1. From the `SpinnakerService` manifest, copy the contents of `spec.spinnakerConfig.config` to its own file named `config`, and save it with the following structure:

   ```
   currentDeployment: default
   deploymentConfigurations:
   - name: default
     <<CONTENT HERE>>
   ```

1. For each entry in `spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles`, copy it to its own file inside a `profiles` folder with a `<entry-name>-local.yml` name.
2. For each entry in `spec.spinnakerConfig.service-settings`, copy it to its own file inside a `service-settings` folder with a `<entry-name>.yml` name.
3. For each entry in `spec.spinnakerConfig.files`, copy it to its own file inside a directory structure following the name of the entry with double underscores (__) replaced by a path separator. For example, an entry named `profiles__rosco__packer__example-packer-config.json` results inthe file `profiles/rosco/packer/example-packer-config.json`.

When finished, you have the following directory tree:

```
config
default/
  profiles/
  service-settings/
```

After that, move these files to your Halyard home directory and deploy Spinnaker with the `hal deploy apply` command.

Finally, delete Operator and their CRDs from the Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl delete -n <namespace> -f deploy/operator/<installation type>
kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/
```

### Removing Operator Ownership from Spinnaker Resources

Run the following script to remove ownership of Spinnaker resources, where `NAMESPACE` is the namespace where Spinnaker is installed:

```
NAMESPACE=
for rtype in deployment service
do
    for r in $(kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get $rtype --selector=app=spin -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
    do
        kubectl -n $NAMESPACE patch $rtype $r --type json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/ownerReferences"}]'
    done
done
```
After the script completes, delete the operator and their CRDs from the Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl delete -n <namespace> -f deploy/operator/<installation type>
kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/
```
