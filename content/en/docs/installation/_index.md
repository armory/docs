## Methods for installing Armory Enterprise

There are several methods to install Armory or open source Spinnaker:

| Method                             | Environment           | Description                                                          | Benefits                                                            |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Armory Operator]({{< ref "operator" >}})   | Kubernetes            | Kubernetes Operator that turns Armory's configuration declarative | GitOps friendly and ready for production use                                 |
| [Armory Halyard]({{< ref "armory-halyard" >}}) | Kubernetes            | Versatile command line interface to configure and deploy Armory   | Quick Setup                                                     |
| [Minnaker]({{< ref "minnaker" >}})             | MacOS, Linux, Windows | Spin up a whole environment on top of Rancher K3s to deploy Armory or Spinnaker    | This is ideal if you do not have a Kubernetes cluster available and want to try out Armory or Spinnaker |
| [Operator]({{< ref "operator" >}})   | Kubernetes            | An open source Kubernetes Operator that installs open source Spinnaker | GitOps friendly and ready for production use                                 |


All the preceding methods share similar configurations, and you can migrate between them if your needs change.

> Armory does not generate default usernames and passwords for user accounts for any service. Manage these by configuring authentication and authorization for the Armory Platform.
