### App Engine

**spec.spinnakerConfig.config.providers.appengine**

The App Engine provider is used to deploy resources to any number of App Engine applications. To get started with App Engine, visit [the App Engine docs](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/). An account in the App Engine provider refers to a single App Engine application. Spinnaker assumes that your App Engine application already exists.

```yaml
appengine:
  enabled: false
  gcloudPath:
  accounts:
  - name: prod-1
    cachingIntervalSeconds:
    environment:
    gcloudReleaseTrack:

The AWS provider requires a central "Managing Account" to authenticate on behalf of other AWS accounts, or act as your sole, credential-based account.

- `enabled`: whether the provider is enabled
- `accessKeyId`:  AWS Access Key ID; note that if you are baking AMIs via Rosco, you may also need to set the access key on the AWS bakery default options.
- `accounts`: list of configured accounts
- `bakeryDefaults`:  configuration for Spinnaker's image bakery.Configuration for Spinnaker's image bakery.
- `defaults`: array with single entry:
  - `iamRole: BaseIAMRole`
- `defaultKeyPairTemplate`: "{{name}}-keypair"
- `defaultRegions`: array of `name: <region-name>` items
- `features`: configuration for AWS-specific features
- `primaryAccount`: the account you want to be primary of the configured accounts
- `secretAccessKey`: AWS Secret Key; note that if you are baking AMIs via Rosco, you may also need to set the secret key on the AWS bakery default options. Supports encrypted value.

Using will make Spinnaker use AWS regions in the hostname to access discovery so that you can have discovery for multiple regions.
- `edda`: The endpoint at which Edda is reachable. Edda is not a hard dependency of Spinnaker, but is helpful for reducing the request volume against AWS. See https://github.com/Netflix/edda for more information.
- `environment`: The environment name for the account. Many accounts can share the same environment (e.g. dev, test, prod)
- `lifecycleHooks`: Configuration for AWS Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hooks. For more information, see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html

     - `spotPrice`:The maximum hourly price to pay for a spot instance to create the AMI. Spot instances are a type of instance that EC2 starts when the current spot price is less than the maximum price you specify. Spot price will be updated based on available spot instance capacity and current spot instance requests. It may save you some costs. You can set this to auto for Packer to automatically discover the best spot price or to "0" to use an on demand instance (default).
     - `spotPriceAutoProduct`:Required if spotPrice is set to auto. This tells Packer what sort of AMI you are launching to find the best spot price. This must be one of: Linux/UNIX, SUSE Linux, Windows, Linux/UNIX (Amazon VPC), SUSE Linux (Amazon VPC), Windows (Amazon VPC).

- `enabled`: Whether the provider is enabled.
- `accounts`: the list of configured accounts
- `primaryAccount`: The name of the primary account.
- `bakeryDefaults`: configuration for Spinnaker's image bakery

#### Account parameters

- `name`: name of the account
- `alphaListed`: (*Default*: `false`) Enable this flag if your project has access to alpha features and you want Spinnaker to take advantage of them.
- `environment`: The environment name for the account. Many accounts can share the same environment (e.g. dev, test, prod)
- `imageProjects`: (*Default*: `[]`) A list of Google Cloud Platform projects Spinnaker will be able to cache and deploy images from. When this is omitted, it defaults to the current project. Each project must have granted the IAM role `compute.imageUser` to the service account associated with the json key used by this account, as well as to the 'Google APIs service account' automatically created for the project being managed (should look similar to `12345678912@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com`). See [Sharing Images Across Projects](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/sharing-images-across-projects) for more information about sharing images across GCP projects.
- `jsonPath`: The path to a JSON service account that Spinnaker will use as credentials. This is only needed if Spinnaker is not deployed on a Google Compute Engine VM, or needs permissions not afforded to the VM it is running on. See [https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts) for more information. File needs to be present on the machine running Spinnaker. Supports encrypted file.
- `permissions`:
    - `READ`: `[]` A user must have at least one of these roles in order to view this account's cloud resources.
    - `WRITE`: `[]` A user must have at least one of these roles in order to make changes to this account's cloud resources.
    - `EXECUTE`:
    - `CREATE`:

- `readPermissions`: (*Default*: `[]`) A user must have at least one of these roles in order to view this account's cloud resources.
- `regions`: A list of regions for caching and mutating calls. This overwrites any default-regions set on the provider.
- `userDataFile`: The path to user data template file. Spinnaker has the ability to inject userdata into generated instance templates. The mechanism is via a template file that is token replaced to provide some specifics about the deployment. See [https://github.com/spinnaker/clouddriver/blob/master/clouddriver-aws/UserData.md](https://github.com/spinnaker/clouddriver/blob/master/clouddriver-aws/UserData.md) for more information. File needs to be present on the machine running Spinnaker.
- `consul`: Configuration for Consul.
  - `enabled`: Whether Consul is enabled.
  - `agentEndpoint`: Reachable Consul node endpoint connected to the Consul cluster. Defaults to localhost.
  - `agentPort`: Port consul is running on for every agent.

- `shortDescription`: A short description to help human operators identify the image.
- `templateFile`: This is the name of the packer template that will be used to bake images from this base image. The template file must be found in this list [https://github.com/spinnaker/rosco/tree/master/rosco-web/config/packer](https://github.com/spinnaker/rosco/tree/master/rosco-web/config/packer), or supplied as described here: [https://spinnaker.io/setup/bakery/](https://spinnaker.io/setup/bakery/)
- `virtualizationSettings`:
  - `sourceImage`: The source image. If both source image and source image family are set, source image will take precedence.

### Kubernetes

**spec.spinnakerConfig.config.providers.kubernetes**

The Kubernetes provider is used to deploy Kubernetes resources to any number of Kubernetes clusters. Spinnaker assumes you have a Kubernetes cluster already running. If you don't, you must configure one: [https://Kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).

Before proceeding, please visit [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/) to make sure you're familiar with the authentication terminology.


```yaml
kubernetes:
  enabled: true
  accounts:
  - name: spinnaker
    context:
    cluster:
    user:
    configureImagePullSecrets:

    requiredGroupMembership:
    permissions:
      READ:
      WRITE:
      EXECUTE:
      CREATE:
  primaryAccount: spinnaker
```

- `enabled`: Whether the provider is enabled.
- `accounts`: the list of configured accounts
- `primaryAccount`: The name of the primary account.

#### Account parameters

An account in the Kubernetes provider refers to a single Kubernetes context. In Kubernetes, a context is the combination of a Kubernetes cluster and some credentials. If no context is specified, the default context in in your `kubeconfig` is assumed. You must also provide a set of Docker Registries for each account. Spinnaker will automatically upload that Registry's credentials to the specified Kubernetes cluster allowing you to deploy those images without further configuration.

- `name`: spinnaker
- `context`: The kubernetes context to be managed by Spinnaker. See http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubeconfig-file/#context for more information. When no context is configured for an account the 'current-context' in your kubeconfig is assumed.
- `cluster`: Used with V1 provider (deprecated)
- `user`: Used with V1 provider (deprecated)
- `configureImagePullSecrets`: Used with V1 provider. When true, Spinnaker will create & manage your image pull secrets for you; when false, you will have to create and attach them to your pod specs by hand.
- `serviceAccount`: When true, Spinnaker attempt to authenticate against Kubernetes using a Kubernetes service account. This only works when Halyard & Spinnaker are deployed in Kubernetes. Read more about service accounts here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/.
- `cacheThreads`: Number of caching agents for this kubernetes account. Each agent handles a subset of the namespaces available to this account. By default, only 1 agent caches all kinds for all namespaces in the account.
- `namespaces`: A list of namespaces this Spinnaker account can deploy to and will cache. When no namespaces are configured, this defaults to 'all namespaces'.
- `omitNamespaces`: A list of namespaces this Spinnaker account cannot deploy to or cache. This can only be set when --namespaces is empty or not set.
- `kinds`: (V2 Only) A list of resource kinds this Spinnaker account can deploy to and will cache. When no kinds are configured, this defaults to 'all kinds described here https://spinnaker.io/reference/providers/kubernetes-v2/'.
- `omitKinds`: (V2 Only) A list of resource kinds this Spinnaker account cannot deploy to or cache. This can only be set when --kinds is empty or not set.
- `customResources`: (V2 Only) List of Kubernetes custom resources to managed by clouddriver and made available for use in patch and delete manifest stages.
    - `versioned`: true or false
	- `kubernetesKind`: Fully qualified name of the Kubernetes CRD
	- `spinnakerKind`: One of instances, configs, serverGroups, loadBalancers, securityGroups, serverGroupManagers, unclassified
- `cachingPolicies`:
  - `kubernetesKind`:
  - `maxEntriesPerAgent`:
- `kubeconfigFile`: The path to your kubeconfig file. By default, it will be under the Spinnaker user's home directory in the typical .kube/config location. File needs to be present on the machine running Spinnaker. Supports encrypted file.
- `kubeconfigContents`: Inline kubeconfig file contents
- `kubectlPath`: Alternate path inside clouddriver pod of the kubectl binary
- `kubectlRequestTimeoutSeconds`: Timeout in seconds of kubectl calls
- `checkPermissionsOnStartup`:  When false, clouddriver will skip the permission checks for all Kubernetes Kinds at startup. This can save a great deal of time during clouddriver startup when you have many Kubernetes accounts configured. This disables the log messages at startup about missing permissions.
- `liveManifestCalls`: When true, clouddriver will query manifest status during pipeline executions using live data rather than the cache. This eliminates all time spent in the "force cache refresh" task in pipelines, greatly reducing execution time.
- `oAuthServiceAccount`: File needs to be present on the machine running Spinnaker. Supports encrypted file.
- `oAuthScopes`:
- `namingStrategy`:
- `skin`:
- `onlySpinnakerManaged`: (V2 Only) When `true`, Spinnaker only caches and displays applications that have been created by Spinnaker.  Before placing in a `false` state, you should review the Kubernetes cluster configuration.  When `false`, Spinnaker analyzes the cluster and automatically attempts to configure and populate applications for resources already present in Kubernetes, unless limited with `omitNamespaces`. You should note the [increased possibilities of misconfigured Autogenerated Application Placeholders in the deployments](https://kb.armory.io/s/article/Autogenerated-Applications-Cannot-be-Deleted-w-onlySpinnakerManaged-set-to-false).
- `debug`: true or false
- `dockerRegistries`:
    - `accountName`: dockerhub
    - `namespaces`:
- `providerVersion`: V2
- `permissions`:
    - `READ`: `[]` A user must have at least one of these roles in order to view this account's cloud resources.
    - `WRITE`: `[]` A user must have at least one of these roles in order to make changes to this account's cloud resources.
    - `EXECUTE`:
    - `CREATE`:
- `requiredGroupMembership`: `[]` (Deprecated): Configure permissions instead.
