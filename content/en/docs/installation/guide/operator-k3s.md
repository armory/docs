## Overview of installing Armory for proof of concept (POC) work

This guide walks you through using the [Armory Operator]({{< ref "armory-operator" >}}) to install Armory Enterprise in a [Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s)](https://k3s.io/) instance running on an AWS EC2 instance. The environment is for POCs and development only. It is **not** meant for production environments.

See the [Armory Operator Quickstart]({{< ref "op-quickstart" >}}) guide for how to install Armory Enterprise using the Armory Operator in a regular Kubernetes environment.

If you want to install open source Spinnaker<sup>TM</sup>, use the open source [Spinnaker Operator](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator) instead of the Armory Operator.

## {{% heading "prereq" %}}

* Know how to create a VM in AWS [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)
* Be familiar with [AWS IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) and [S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html)
* Have knowledge of [Kubernetes Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/), which use custom resources to manage applications and their components
* Understand the concept of [managing Kubernetes resources using manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/)

## Create an AWS EC2 instance

* Requirements:

  * Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type; 64-bit (x86)
  * Minimum 2 vCPUs
  * Minimum 8 GB of memory
  * Minimum of 50 GB of storage
  * Public IP

## Install K3s

SSH into your VM and run the following command to install the latest version of K3s:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
```

Output is similar to:

```bash

```

## Create an S3 bucket

Spinnaker's Front50 service needs access to an S3 bucket, so create an S3 bucket with a globally unique name. See the [Creating a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) page in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service_ docs for how to create a bucket and naming constraints.

On the **Configure options** screen, select **Versioning** and **Default encryption**.

![ Create bucket - configure options](/images/installation/guide/create-bucket-config-options.jpg)

On the **Set permissions** screen, select **Block all public access**.

Create your bucket.

## Create an IAM Role

Create an IAM Role that you will attach to your EC2 instance. Calls to S3 use this role to get credentials for the requests. You can read more about IAM Roles in AWS' [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html) guide.

1. From the **Services** menu, select **IAM** in the **Security, Identity, & Compliance** section.

   ![ Select IAM](/images/installation/guide/selectIAM.png)

1. Select the **Roles** section.

   ![ Select Roles section](/images/installation/guide/selectRolesSection.png)

1. Press the **Create role** button.

   ![ Press Create role](/images/installation/guide/createRoleButton.png)

1. **AWS Service** is highlighted. Select **EC2**. Then press the **Next: Permissions** button.

   ![ Select EC2](/images/installation/guide/createIAMRoleForEc2-01.png)


1. In the **Filter policies** field, type "s3" and press enter. This action displays polices for S3. Select **AmazonS3FullAccess**. Then press the **Next: Tags** button.

   ![ Select AmazonS3FullAccess](/images/installation/guide/roleSelectS3Policy-02.png)

1. You can optionally add tags to your Role. Press the **Next: Review** button to move to the **Review** screen. Type in a name for your role in the **Role name** field and then press the **Create role** button.

   ![ Role review](/images/installation/guide/roleReview03.png)

## Attach your IAM Role to your EC2 instance

1. Navigate to the EC2 services screen and then access your running instance. Select your instance. From the **Actions** menu, select **Instance Settings** and then **Attach/Replace IAM Role**.

   ![ Attach Replace IAM Role](/images/installation/guide/assignRoleToVM01.jpg)

1. Select the **IAM role** you created in the previous section. The press **Apply**.

## Install the Armory Operator

Install the Armory Operator in _basic_ mode, which installs Armory into a single namespace. This mode does not perform pre-flight checks before applying a manifest.

1. SSH into your EC2 VM and download the Armory Operator files:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p spinnaker-operator && cd spinnaker-operator
   bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/armory-io/spinnaker-operator/releases/latest/download/manifests.tgz | tar -xz'
   ```

1. Install the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/
   ```

1. Create the `spinnaker-operator` namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl create ns spinnaker-operator
   ```

1. Install the Armory Operator on K3s:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n spinnaker-operator apply -f deploy/operator/basic
   ```

   You can verify successful installation by executing:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n spinnaker-operator get pods
   ```

   Terminal output is similar to:

   ```bash
   NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   spinnaker-operator-589ccc6fd4-56wlc   2/2     Running   0          4m28s
   ```

## Modify the Armory manifest

Edit the `SpinnakerService.yml` manifest file located in the `~/spinnaker-operator/deploy/spinnaker/basic` directory.

You can find detailed configuration information in the {{< linkWithTitle "op-config-manifest.md" >}} guide.

### Update Armory version and S3 bucket name

Update the `spec.spinnakerConfig.config.version` value to the version of Armory you want to deploy. Check the [Release Notes]({{< ref "rn-armory-spinnaker" >}}) if you are unsure which version to install. Choose v2.20.4, v2.20.5 or v2.21+ if you want to deploy plugins.

Additionally, replace **myBucket** (`spec.spinnakerConfig.config.persistentStorage.s3.bucket`) with the name of the s3 bucket you created in [Create an S3 Bucket](#create-an-s3-bucket).

Before editing:

```yaml
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  # spec.spinnakerConfig - This section is how to specify configuration spinnaker
  spinnakerConfig:
    # spec.spinnakerConfig.config - This section contains the contents of a deployment found in a halconfig .deploymentConfigurations[0]
    config:
      version: 2.15.1   # the version of Spinnaker to be deployed
      persistentStorage:
        persistentStoreType: s3
        s3:
          bucket: mybucket
          rootFolder: front50
```

This example shows the config if your bucket is named `my-s3-bucket` and you want to install Armory 2.21.1::

```yaml
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  # spec.spinnakerConfig - This section is how to specify configuration spinnaker
  spinnakerConfig:
    # spec.spinnakerConfig.config - This section contains the contents of a deployment found in a halconfig .deploymentConfigurations[0]
    config:
      version: 2.21.1   # the version of Spinnaker to be deployed
      persistentStorage:
        persistentStoreType: s3
        s3:
          bucket: my-s3-bucket
          rootFolder: front50
```

### Modifications for running on K3s

Create a `spec.spinnakerConfig.config.security` section like the example below, replacing `<your-vm-ip>` with the public IP address of your EC2 instance. The `security` section is at the same level as the `persistentStorage` section.

```yaml
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  # spec.spinnakerConfig - This section is how to specify configuration spinnaker
  spinnakerConfig:
    # spec.spinnakerConfig.config - This section contains the contents of a deployment found in a halconfig .deploymentConfigurations[0]
    config:
      version: 2.21.1   # the version of Spinnaker to be deployed
      persistentStorage:
        persistentStoreType: s3
        s3:
          bucket: my-s3-bucket
          rootFolder: front50
      security:
        apiSecurity: # Gate
          overrideBaseUrl: <your-vm-ip>:8084
        uiSecurity: # Deck
          overrideBaseUrl: <your-vm-ip>:9000
```

Find the `expose.service.overrides` section at the bottom of the file. Add configuration for Deck and Gate.

```yaml
expose:
  type: service  # Kubernetes LoadBalancer type (service/ingress), note: only "service" is supported for now
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: http
    # provide an override to the exposing KubernetesService
  overrides:
    deck:
      publicPort: 9000
    gate:
      publicPort: 8084
```

Spacing is very important in YAML files. Make sure that the spacing is correct in the `SpinnakerService.yml` file and that there are no tabs instead of spaces. Incorrect spacing or tabs cause errors when you install Spinnaker.

## Install Armory

Because you installed the Armory Operator in `basic` mode, you must install Armory into the same `spinnaker-operator` namespace. Use [`kubectl apply`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply) to deploy the Armory manifest:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker-operator apply -f deploy/spinnaker/basic/SpinnakerService.yml
```

You can watch the installation progress by executing:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker-operator get spinsvc spinnaker -w
```

You can verify pod status by executing:

```bash
 kubectl -n spinnaker-operator get pods
 ```

## Upgrade Armory

[Upgrade Armory]({{< ref "armory-operator#upgrading-spinnaker" >}}) by changing the `version` value in `SpinnakerService.yml` and using `kubectl` to apply the manifest.

## Delete Armory

Since you installed Armory in the same namespace as the Armory Operator, do not delete the `spinnaker-operator` namespace unless you want to delete the Armory Operator as well.

You can use the [`kubectl delete`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#delete) command to delete Armory:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker-operator delete spinnakerservice spinnaker
```

## Troubleshooting

You can access the Armory Operator logs by executing:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker-operator logs deploy/spinnaker-operator -c spinnaker-operator
```

Operator uses Halyard, so you can access the Halyard logs by executing:

```bash
kubectl -n spinnaker-operator logs deploy/spinnaker-operator -c halyard
```
