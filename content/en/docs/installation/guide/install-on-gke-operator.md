This guide contains instructions for installing Armory on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster using the [Armory Operator]({{< ref "operator" >}}). Refer to the [Armory Operator Reference]({{< ref "operator-config" >}}) for manifest entry details.

> If you want to install Spinnaker<sup>TM</sup>, use the open source Operator, which you can download from its GitHub [repo](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator).

## Prerequisites for installing Armory and the Armory Operator

* You have a machine configured to use the `gcloud` CLI tool and a recent
  version of the `kubectl` tool
* You have logged into the `gcloud` CLI and have permissions to create GKE
  clusters and a service account

## Armory installation summary

Installing Armory using the Armory Operator consists of the following steps:

* Create a cluster where Armory and the Armory Operator will reside
* Deploy Armory Operator pods to the cluster
* Create a GCS service account
* Create a Kubernetes service account
* Create a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket
* Modify the Armory Operator kustomize files for your installation
* Deploy Armory using the Armory Operator

## Create a GKE cluster

This creates a minimal GKE cluster in your default region and zone.

```bash
gcloud container clusters create spinnaker-cluster
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig-gke
gcloud container clusters get-credentials spinnaker-cluster
```

Check that namespaces have been created:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig-gke get namespaces
```

Output is similar to:

```bash
NAME STATUS AGE
default Active 2m24s
kube-node-lease Active 2m26s
kube-public Active 2m26s
kube-system Active 2m26s
```

## Create a GCS service account

```bash
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=<name-for-your-service-account>
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=<name=for-your-service-account.json>
export PROJECT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')

gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts create \
    ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
    --display-name ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}

SA_EMAIL=$(gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts list \
    --filter="displayName:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" \
    --format='value(email)')

gcloud --project ${PROJECT} projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT} \
    --role roles/storage.admin --member serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}

mkdir -p $(dirname ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE})

gcloud --project ${PROJECT} iam service-accounts keys create ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE} \
    --iam-account ${SA_EMAIL}
```

## Create Kubernetes service account

```bash
CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

# This service account uses the ClusterAdmin role -- this is not necessary,
# more restrictive roles can by applied.
curl -s https://spinnaker.io/downloads/kubernetes/service-account.yml | \
  sed "s/spinnaker-service-account/${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}/g" | \
  kubectl apply --context $CONTEXT -f -


TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret --context $CONTEXT \
   $(kubectl get serviceaccount ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --context $CONTEXT \
       -n spinnaker \
       -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}') \
   -n spinnaker \
   -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)

kubectl config set-credentials ${CONTEXT}-token-user --token $TOKEN

kubectl config set-context $CONTEXT --user ${CONTEXT}-token-user
```

## Create a GCS bucket

Use the Cloud Console to [create your bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets). If you're
going to put secrets in the bucket, make sure to create a secrets directory in
that bucket. Also, make sure that the Kubernetes service account you created can access the bucket.

## Customize your Spinnaker installation

### Add GCP credentials as a cluster secret

The kustomize template repository that you cloned enables you to
easily create Secret objects within your Kubernetes cluster so you can securely access
credentials. Place the `${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE}` file in the `./secrets/files`
directory and run the `./secrets/create-secrets.sh` script.

### Adding persistance to Spinnaker

Create a file in your kustomize directory called `./patch-gcs.yml` and add
it to the `patchesStrategicMerge` section of your `kustomization.yml` file.

The contents of that file should look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    config:
      persistentStorage:
        persistentStoreType: gcs
        gcs:
          bucket: <YOUR_GCS_BUCKET_NAME>
          rootFolder: front50  
          jsonPath: encryptedFile:k8s!n:spin-secrets!k:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE>
```

Remember to replace `<YOUR_GCS_BUCKET_NAME>` with your bucket name. You should also update the `<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE>` at the end of the `jsonPath` segment with the name of the service account file you added in the
[Add GCP credentials as a cluster secret](#add-gcp-credentials-as-a-cluster-secret) section.

## Install Kustomize (optional)

You can do a `kubectl -k` to deploy Kustomize templates, but what may be more
helpful is to install Kustomize standalone so that you can build Kustomize and
look at the YAML first.

```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\
kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/master/hack/install_kustomize.sh"  | bash
sudo mv kustomize /usr/local/bin/
```

## Deploy Armory using Kustomize

```bash
kubectl create ns <spinnaker-namespace>
kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Configure ingress

The `spinnaker-kustomize-patches` repository contains several examples for
exposing ingress to your cluster. Consult the examples in the `expose`
directory and choose the most appropriate example for your environment. Make
any modifications to the examples for your environment, then make sure the file
is listed in the `patchesStrategicMerge` section of your `kustomization.yml`
file.

See [spec.expose](/operator_reference/operator-config/#specexpose) for more
information.

## Configure authentication

The `spinnaker-kustomize-patches` repository contains several examples for
adding authentication to your cluster. Consult the examples in the `security`
directory and choose the most appropriate example for your environment. For
example, to enable basic auth, modify the `security/patch-basic-auth.yml` by
changing the username to one of your choosing. Then, add the file path to your
`kustomization.yml` file in the `patchesStrategicMerge` section. Finally,
modify the `secrets-example.env` file to choose a password unique to you, and
run the `./create-secrets.sh` script to create Kubernetes credentials in your
cluster.

>Make sure you enable the right Auth Scopes on the GKE node pools, or you may see authentication issues trying to write to Google Cloud Storage for logging.

## Configure Dinghy

The `spinnaker-kustomize-patches` repository contains a patch for enabling
Dinghy in your Armory cluster.  Be sure to modify the `armory/patch-dinghy.yml`
file with configuration specific to your environment, then make sure the file
is listed in the `patchesStrategicMerge` section of your `kustomization.yml`
file.

Now add an entry to the end of `kustomization.yml` to include
`patch-dinghy.yml`.

## Other patch files

The `spinnaker-kustomize-patches` repository contains many more example patches
to further customize your Armory cluster. Explore the
[repository](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-kustomize-patches/tree/master)to
see if there are features you'd like to try out.
