## spec.spinnakerConfig.config.security

Configure Spinnaker's security. This includes external SSL, authentication mechanisms, and authorization policies.

```yaml
security:
  apiSecurity:
  uiSecurity:
  authn:
  authz:
```

- `apiSecurity`
- `uiSecurity`
- `authn`
- `authz`

## API

**spec.spinnakerConfig.config.security.apiSecurity**

```yaml
apiSecurity:
  ssl:
    enabled:
    keyAlias:
    keyStore:
    keyStoreType:
    keyStorePassword:
    trustStore:
    trustStoreType:
    trustStorePassword:
    clientAuth:
  overrideBaseUrl:
  corsAccessPattern:
```

- `ssl`:
- `overrideBaseUrl`: If you are accessing the API server remotely, provide the full base URL (including protocol) of whatever proxy or load balancer is fronting the API requests.
- `corsAccessPattern`: `^.*$` If you have authentication enabled, are accessing Spinnaker remotely, and are logging in from sources other than the UI, provide a regex matching all URLs authentication redirects may come from.

### SSL parameters

  userSearchBase:
  userSearchFilter:
  managerDn:
  managerPassword:
  groupSearchBase:
```

- `enabled`: true or false.
- `url`: ldap:// or ldaps:// url of the LDAP server
- `userDnPattern`: The pattern for finding a user's DN using simple pattern matching. For example, if your LDAP server has the URL ldap://mysite.com/dc=spinnaker,dc=org, and you have the pattern 'uid={0},ou=members', 'me' will map to a DN uid=me,ou=members,dc=spinnaker,dc=org. If no match is found, will try to find the user using user-search-filter, if set.
- `userSearchBase`: The part of the directory tree under which user searches should be performed. If user-search-base isn't supplied, the search will be performed from the root.
- `userSearchFilter`: The filter to use when searching for a user's DN. Will search either from user-search-base (if specified) or root for entires matching the filter, then attempt to bind as that user with the login password. For example, the filter 'uid={0}' would apply to any user where uid matched the user's login name. If --user-dn-pattern is also specified, will attempt to find a match using the specified pattern first, before searching with the specified search filter if no match is found from the pattern.
- `managerDn`: An LDAP manager user is required for binding to the LDAP server for the user authentication process. This property refers to the DN of that entry. I.e. this is not the user which will be authenticated when logging into DHIS2, rather the user which binds to the LDAP server in order to do the authentication.
- `managerPassword`: The password for the LDAP manager user.
- `groupSearchBase`: The part of the directory tree under which group searches should be performed.

### x509
