## Upgrade the Operator

>Do not manually change Docker image tags in your existing manifest files. Operator computes the compatible Halyard version, so manually updating image tags is an **unsupported** upgrade method and may cause issues.

Use the `kubectl replace` command to replace your Operator deployment. See the `kubectl replace` [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#replace) for an explanation of this command.

1. Download the Operator version you want to upgrade to:

   In the following command, replace `<version>` with the specific version or "latest" for the most recent version.

   ```bash
   bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/armory-io/spinnaker-operator/releases/<version>/download/manifests.tgz | tar -xz'
   ```

1. Update CRDs across the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl replace -f deploy/crds/
   ```

1. Update the Operator:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n spinnaker-operator replace -f deploy/operator/cluster
   ```

## Uninstall the Operator

Uninstalling the Operator involves deleting its deployment and `SpinnakerService` CRD. When you delete the Operator CRD, Kubernetes deletes any installation created by Operator. This occurs because the CRD is set as the owner of the resources, so they get garbage collected.

There are two ways in which you can remove this ownership relationship so that Armory Enterprise is not deleted when deleting the Operator: [replace Operator with Halyard](#replace-operator-with-halyard) or [removing Operator ownership of resources](#remove-operator-ownership-of-spinnaker-resources).

### Replace Operator with Halyard

First, export configuration settings to a format that Halyard understands:

1. From the `SpinnakerService` manifest, copy the contents of `spec.spinnakerConfig.config` to its own file named `config`, and save it with the following structure:

   ```yaml
   currentDeployment: default
   deploymentConfigurations:
   - name: default
     <<CONTENT HERE>>
   ```

1. For each entry in `spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles`, copy it to its own file inside a `profiles` folder with a `<entry-name>-local.yml` name.
1. For each entry in `spec.spinnakerConfig.service-settings`, copy it to its own file inside a `service-settings` folder with a `<entry-name>.yml` name.
1. For each entry in `spec.spinnakerConfig.files`, copy it to its own file inside a directory structure following the name of the entry with double underscores (__) replaced by a path separator. For example, an entry named `profiles__rosco__packer__example-packer-config.json` results in the file `profiles/rosco/packer/example-packer-config.json`.

When finished, you have the following directory tree:

```
config
default/
  profiles/
  service-settings/
```

After that, move these files to your Halyard home directory and deploy Armory Enterprise with the `hal deploy apply` command.

Finally, delete Operator and its CRDs from the Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl delete -n <namespace> -f deploy/operator/<installation type>
kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/
```

### Remove Operator ownership of Armory Enterprise resources

Run the following script to remove ownership of Armory resources, where `NAMESPACE` is the namespace where Armory Enterprise is installed:

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash
NAMESPACE=
for rtype in deployment service
do
    for r in $(kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get $rtype --selector=app=spin -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
    do
        kubectl -n $NAMESPACE patch $rtype $r --type json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/ownerReferences"}]'
    done
done
```

After the script completes, delete the Operator and its CRDs from the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl delete -n <namespace> -f deploy/operator/<installation type>
kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/
```
