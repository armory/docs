## Overview

Project Aurora is plugin that adds a new stage to your Armory Enterprise (Spinnaker) instance. When you use this stage to deploy an app, you can configure how to deploy the stage incrementally by setting percentage thresholds for the deployment. For example, you can deploy the new version of your app to 25% of your target cluster and then wait for a manual judgement or a configurable amount of time. This wait gives you time to assess the impact of your changes. From there, either continue the deployment to the next threshold you set or roll back the deployment.

See the [Architecture]({{< ref "borealis/architecture-borealis" >}}) page for an overview of Project Aurora and how it fits in with Spinnaker.

This guide walks you through the following:

- Registering your Armory Enterprise environment
- Installing the Remote Network Agent (RNA) on your depoloyment target cluster
- Connecting to Armory Cloud services
- Installing the Project Aurora plugin
- Deploying a "hello world" manifest

### Release notes

For the Project Aurora release notes, see the [Armory Changelog](https://armory.releases.live/?labels=Armory+Deployments+Plugin).

## Requirements

Verify that you meet or can meet these requirements before getting started.

### Armory Enterprise (Spinnaker)

Your Armory Enterprise (or OSS Spinnaker) instance must meet the following requirements:

- Version 2.24 or later (or OSS 1.24 or later)
- A supported Operator or Halyard version. For information about what version of Halyard or Operator is supported, see the [release notes]({{< ref "rn-armory-spinnaker" >}}) for your Armory Enterprise version.

### Networking

Ensure that your Armory Enterprise (or Spinnaker) instance and Armory Agents have the following networking access:

| Protocol                    | DNS                                                                    | Port | Used By           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Target Kubernetes cluster

Project Aurora is a separate product from Armory Enterprise (Spinnaker). It does not use Clouddriver to source its accounts. Instead, it uses Remote Network Agents (RNAs) that are deployed in your target Kubernetes clusters. An RNA is a lightweight, scalable service that enables Project Aurora to interact with your infrastructure. You must install RNAs in every target cluster. 

The Helm chart described in [Enable Project Aurora in target Kubernetes clusters](#enable-aurora-in-target-kubernetes-clusters) manages the installation of both of these requirements for you.

## Register your Armory Enterprise environment

Register your Armory Enterprise environment so that it can communicate with Armory services. Each environment needs to get registered if you, for example, have production and development environments.

1. Get your registration link from Armory.
2. Register your Armory Enterprise [environment]({{< ref "ae-instance-reg" >}}).

## Create client credentials for your Agents

1. Log in to the Armory Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.armory.io/.
2. If you have more than one environment, ensure the proper environment is selected in the user context menu:

   {{< figure src="/images/deploy-engine/cloud-env-context.png" alt="The upper right section of the window shows what environment you are currently in." >}}

3. In the left navigation menu, select **Access Management > Client Credentials**.
4. In the upper right corner, select **New Credential**.
5. Create a credential for your RNA. Use a descriptive name for the credential, such as `us-west RNA`
6. Set the permission scope by selecting the preconfigured scope group **Custom Spinnaker**, which assigns the minimum required credentials for Aurora to work:

   - `manage:deploy`
   - `read:infra:data`
   - `exec:infra:op`
   - `read:artifacts:data`

   > Note that removing a preconfigured scope group does not deselect the permissions that the group assigned. You must remove the permissions manually.

7. Note both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You need these values when configuring the Remote Network Agent or other services that you want to use to interact with Aurora and Armory's hosted cloud services. Make sure to store the secret somewhere safe. You are not shown the value again.

## Enable Aurora in target Kubernetes clusters

This section walks you through installing the Remote Network Agent (RNA) using a Helm chart.

{{< include "aurora-borealis/rna-install.md" >}}




If your Armory Enterprise (Spinnaker) environment is behind an HTTPS proxy, you need to configure HTTPS proxy settings. 

<details><summary>Learn more</summary>

To set an HTTPS proxy, use the following config:

```yaml
env[0].name=”HTTPS_PROXY”,env[0].value="<hostname>:<port>"
``` 

You can include the following snippet in your `helm install` command:

```yaml
--set env[0].name=”HTTPS_PROXY”,env[0].value="<hostname>:<port>" 
```

Alternatively, you can create a `values.yaml` file to include the parameters:

```yaml
env:
  - name: HTTPS_PROXY
    value: <hostname>:<port>
```
With the file, you can configure multiple configs in addition to the `env` config in your `helm install` command. Instead of using `--set`, include the `--values` parameter as part of the Helm install command:

```
--values=<path>/values.yaml
```

</details>




### Verify the Agent deployment

In the target deployment cluster, examine the Agent logs.

You should see messages similar to the following that show your client ID and your account getting registered in the Armory Cloud Hub:

```
time="2021-07-16T17:41:45Z" level=info msg="registering with uuid: f69daec0-0a32-4ded-b3ed-dc84bc0e93d0"
time="2021-07-16T17:41:45Z" level=info msg="registering with 1 servers"
time="2021-07-16T17:48:30Z" level=info msg="handling registration 01FAR6Y7EDJW1B5G8JQ109D53G"
time="2021-07-16T17:48:30Z" level=info msg="starting agentCreator provider:\"kubernetes\" name:\"account-test\""
```

## Install the Project Aurora Plugin

> You can configure secrets as outlined in the [Secrets Guide]({{< ref "secrets" >}}). This means you can set the clientSecret value to be a secret token instead of the plain text value.

{{< tabs name="DeploymentPlugin" >}}
{{% tab name="Operator" %}}

If you are running Armory Enterprise 2.26.3, `armory.cloud` block goes in a different location. Instead of `spec.spinnakerConfig.spinnaker`, the block needs to go under both `spec.spinnakerConfig.gate` and `spec.spinnakerConfig.orca`. For more information see [Known issues](#known-issues).

The installation instructions using the Operator are the same except for where the `armory.cloud` block goes. 

In your Kustomize patches directory, create a file named **patch-plugin-deployment.yml** and add the following manifest to it. 

```yaml
#patch-plugin-deployment.yml
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      gate:
        spinnaker:
          extensibility:
            # This snippet is necessary so that Gate can serve your plugin code to Deck
            deck-proxy:
              enabled: true
              plugins:
                Armory.Deployments:
                  enabled: true
                  version: <Latest-version> # Replace this with the latest version from: https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/releases/
            repositories:
              armory-deployment-plugin-releases:
                enabled: true
                url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/master/repositories.json
      # Global Settings
      spinnaker:
        armory.cloud:
          enabled: true
          iam:
            clientId: <clientId for Spinnaker from earlier>
            clientSecret: <clientSecret for Spinnaker from earlier>
            tokenIssuerUrl: https://auth.cloud.armory.io/oauth/token
          api:
            baseUrl: https://api.cloud.armory.io
        spinnaker:
          extensibility:
            plugins:
              Armory.Deployments:
                enabled: true
                version: <Latest-version> # Replace this with the latest version from: https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/releases/
            repositories:

                url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/master/repositories.json
```

Then, include the file under the `patchesStrategicMerge` section of your `kustomization` file:

```yaml
bases:
  - spinnaker.yml
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - patches/patch-plugin-deployment.yml
```      

Apply the changes to your Armory Enterprise instance.

```bash
kubectl apply -k <path-to-kustomize-file>.yml
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Halyard" %}}

If you are running Armory Enterprise 2.26.3, `armory.cloud` block needs to go in `gate-local.yml` and `orca-local.yml` instead of `spinnaker-local.yml`. For more information see [Known issues](#known-issues). Other than the change in location, the installation instructions remain the same.

In the `/.hal/default/profiles` directory, add the following configuration to `spinnaker-local.yml`. If the file does not exist, create it and add the configuration.

```yaml
#spinnaker-local.yml
armory.cloud:
  enabled: true
  iam:
    clientId: <clientId for Spinnaker from earlier>
    clientSecret: <clientSecret for Spinnaker from earlier>
    tokenIssuerUrl: https://auth.cloud.armory.io/oauth/token
  api:
    baseUrl: https://api.cloud.armory.io
spinnaker:

        version: <Latest-version> # Replace this with the latest version from: https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/releases/
    repositories:
      armory-deployment-plugin-releases:
        url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/master/repositories.json
```

In the `/.hal/default/profiles` directory, add the following configuration to `gate-local.yml`. If the file does not exist, create it and add the configuration.

```yaml
#gate-local.yml
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    # This snippet is necessary so that Gate can serve your plugin code to Deck
    deck-proxy:
      enabled: true
      plugins:
        Armory.Deployments:
          enabled: true
          version: <Latest-version> # Replace this with the latest version from: https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/releases/
    repositories:

        enabled: true
        url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/master/repositories.json
```

Apply the changes to your Armory Enterprise instance.

```bash
hal deploy apply
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Verify that the plugin is configured

1. Check that all the services are up and running:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <Armory-Enterprise-namespace> get pods
   ```

2. Navigate to the Armory Enterprise UI.
3. In a new or existing application, create a new pipeline.
4. In this pipeline, select **Add stage** and search for **Kubernetes Progressive**. The stage should appear if the plugin is properly configured.

   {{< figure src="/images/deploy-engine/deploy-engine-stage-UI.jpg" alt="The Kubernetes Progressive stage appears in the Type dropdown when you search for it." >}}

5. In the **Basic Settings** section, verify that you can see the target deployment account in the **Account** dropdown.

   {{< figure src="/images/deploy-engine/deploy-engine-accounts.png" alt="If the plugin is configured properly, you should see the target deployment account in the Account dropdown." >}}.

## Use Project Aurora

In the Armory Enterprise UI, the stage for Project Aurora is called **Kubernetes Progressive**. If you have deployed Kubernetes apps before using Armory Enterprise, this page may look familiar. The key difference between a Kubernetes deployment using Armory Enterprise and Armory Enterprise with Project Aurora is in the **How to Deploy** section.

The **How to Deploy** section is where you define your progressive deployment and consists of two parts:

**Strategy**

This is the deployment strategy you want to use to deploy your Kubernetes app. As part of the early access program, the **Canary** strategy is available. Canary deployments allow you to roll out changes to a predefined percentage of your cluster and increment from there as you monitor the effects of your changes. If something doesn't look quite right, you can initiate a rollback to a previous known good state.

**Steps**

These settings control how the your Kubernetes deployment behaves as Project Aurora deploys it. You can tune two separate but related chracteristics of the deployment:

- **Rollout Ratio**: set the percentage threshold (integer) for how widely an app should get rolled out before pausing.
- **Then wait**: define what triggerse the rollout to continue. The trigger can either be a manul approval (**until approved**) or for a set amount of time, either seconds, minutes or hours (integer).

Create a step for each **Rollout Ratio** you want to define. For example, if you want a deployment to pause at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the app rollout, you need to define 3 steps, one for each of those thresholds. The steps have independent **Then wait** behaviors and can be set to all follow the same behavior or different ones.

### Try out the stage

You can try out Project Aurora and the **Kubernetes Progressive** stage using either the `hello-world` sample manifest described below or an artifact that you have. The `hello-world` example deploys NGINX that intentionally takes longer than usual for demonstration purposes.

Perform the following steps:

1. In the Armory Enterprise UI, select an existing app or create a new one.
2. Create a new pipeline.
3. Add a stage to your pipeline with the following attributes:
   - **Type**: select **Kubernetes Progressive**
   - **Stage Name**: provide a descriptive name or use the autogenerated name.
4. In the **Account** field, select the target Kubernetes cluster you want to deploy to. This is a cluster where the Remote Network Agent is installed
5. For **Manifest Source**, ensure that you select your manifest source. If you are using the `hello-world` sample manifest described later, select **Text**.
6. **Using text as the manifest source:**
   
   In the **Manifest** field, provide your manifest. If you are using the `hello-world` manifest, enter that manifest.

   <details><summary>Show me the <code>hello-world</code> manifest</summary>

   ```yaml
   # A simple nginx deployment with an init container that causes deployment to take longer than usual
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment

             name: demo-app
             ports:
               - containerPort: 80
                 name: http
                 protocol: TCP
         initContainers:
           - command:
               - sh
               - '-c'
               - sleep 10
             image: 'busybox:stable'
             name: sleep
   ```

   </details>

   **Using an existing artifact**

   Select an existing artifact or define a new one as you would for a standard Kubernetes deployment in Armory Enterprise.

7. In the **How to Deploy** section, configure the **Rollout Ratio** and **Then wait** attributes for the deployment.

   Optionally, add more steps to the deployment to configure the rollout behavior. You do not need to create a step for 100% Rollout Ratio. Project Aurora automatically scales the deployment to 100% after the final step you configure.

8.  Save the pipeline.
9.  Trigger a manual execution of the pipeline.

On the **Pipelines** page of the Armory Enterprise UI, select the pipeline and watch the deployment progress. If you set the **Then wait** behavior of any step to **until approved**, this is where you approve the rollout and allow it to continue. After completing the final step you configured, Project Aurora scales the deployment to 100% of the cluster if needed.

## Known issues and limitations

### Manifest limitations

{{< include "known-issues/ki-borealis-manifest-limitation.md" >}}

### `armory.cloud` block location

In Armory Enterprise 2.26.3, the location of where you put the `armory.cloud` config block is different from other versions.

Your `spinnaker-local.yml` file should not have the `armory.cloud` block anymore and only contain the block to install the Aurora plugin:

```yaml
#spinnaker-local.yml
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    plugins:
      Armory.Deployments:
        enabled: true
        version: <Latest-version> # Replace this with the latest version from: https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/releases/
    repositories:
      armory-deployment-plugin-releases:
        url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/master/repositories.json
```

Your `gate-local.yml` file should include the `extensibility` and the `armory.cloud` configurations like the following example:

```yaml
#gate-local.yml
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    # This snippet is necessary so that Gate can serve your plugin code to Deck
    deck-proxy:
      enabled: true
      plugins:
        Armory.Deployments:
          enabled: true
          version: <Latest-version> # Replace this with the latest version from: https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/releases/
    repositories:
      armory-deployment-plugin-releases:
        enabled: true
        url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armory-plugins/armory-deployment-plugin-releases/master/repositories.json
armory.cloud:
  enabled: true
  iam:
    clientId: <clientId for Spinnaker from earlier>
    clientSecret: <clientSecret for Spinnaker from earlier>
    tokenIssuerUrl: https://auth.cloud.armory.io/oauth/token
  api:
    baseUrl: https://api.cloud.armory.io
```

Your `orca-local.yml` file should include the `armory.cloud` configration like the following:

```yaml
#orca-local.yml
armory.cloud:
  enabled: true
  iam:
    clientId: <clientId for Spinnaker from earlier>
    clientSecret: <clientSecret for Spinnaker from earlier>
    tokenIssuerUrl: https://auth.cloud.armory.io/oauth/token
  api:
    baseUrl: https://api.cloud.armory.io
```
