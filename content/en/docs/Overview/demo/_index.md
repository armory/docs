## Overview

Armory Enteprise for Spinnaker is an superset of Spinnaker, which itself is a collection of microservices working in concert to create a single continuous delivery / deployment service.

Installation and configuration of Armory Enterprise for Spinnaker can seem a daunting task for those not yet familiar with open-source Spinnaker, so we created Minnaker: a demo deployment of Spinnaker designed to run in a single instance (EC2 or other virtual machine).

## Features
