## Configuring a Github Trigger

Spinnaker pipelines can be configured to trigger when a change is committed
to a Github repository.  This doesn't require any configuration of Spinnaker
other than [adding a Github trigger](/docs/spinnaker-user-guides/github/) but does
require administration of the Github repositories to configure the webhook.

The open source documentation
[has concise instructions for configuring Github webhooks.](https://www.spinnaker.io/setup/triggers/github/)

## Configuring Github as an Artifact Source

If you actually want to use a file from the Github commit in your pipeline,
you'll need to configure Github as an artifact source.

This is just a quick walkthrough of how to configure your Spinnaker to access a
Github repo as a source of artifacts.  Many of the commands below have
additional options that may be useful (or possibly required).  If you need
more detailed help, take a look at the
[Halyard command reference](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/commands/#hal-config-artifact-github) if you're deploying Spinnaker with Halyard.

### Enable Github Artifacts

If you haven't done this yet (for example, if you've just installed Armory
Spinnaker fresh), you'll need to enable Github as an artifact source:

**Operator**

Add the following snippet to `SpinnakerService` manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:  
    config:
      features:
        artifacts: true
      artifacts:
        github:
          enabled: true
```

**Halyard**

```bash
hal config features edit --artifacts true
hal config artifact github enable
```

### Add a Github Credential

To access private Github repositories, you'll need a Github "Personal Access
Token".  This can be generated by going to the "Settings" page in Github, then
clicking on "Developer Settings" and then "Personal Access Token".  The token
will need the `repo` scope.

Once you have a token, you should provide that token for Spinnaker's Igor service
as a credential to use to access Github.  This can be done with a command like
this:

*Replace the account name `github_user` with the string you want to use to identify this Github credential.*

**Operator**

Add the following snippet to `SpinnakerService` manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:  
    config:
      features:
        artifacts: true
      artifacts:
        github:
          enabled: true
          accounts:
          - name: github_user
            token: abc  # Github's personal access token. This fields supports `encrypted` references to secrets.
            # username: abc # GitHub username
            # password: abc # GitHub password. This fields supports `encryptedreferences` to secrets.
            # usernamePasswordFile: creds.txt # File containing "username:password" to use for GitHub authentication. This fields supports `encryptedFilereferences` to secrets.
            # tokenFile: token.txt # File containing a GitHub authentication token. This fields supports `encryptedFile` references to secrets.
```

If you have a Github personal access token, you only need that to authenticate against Github, but there are other authentication options like username/password, or specifying credentials in a `file` entry.

Don't forget to apply your changes:

```bash
kubectl -n >spinnaker namespace> apply -f <SpinnakerService manifest>
```

**Halyard**

```bash
GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME=github_user
hal config artifact github account add ${GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
    --token # you'll be prompted for this interactively
```

Detailed information on all command line options can be found [here](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/commands/#hal-config-artifact-github-account-add).

Don't forget to run `hal deploy apply` to apply your changes.

## Using the Github Credential

You may note that the above Github "account" doesn't actually have a endpoint for
your Github; this account is basically just the credential used by Spinnaker
artifacts to access Github.  The actual Github API endpoint is specified in the
artifact reference.  There are a couple ways to use this credential, one example
of which is detailed here:

### Pulling a Kubernetes Manifest from Github

1. Under "Expected Artifacts" in your pipeline, create an artifact of type "Github".

1. Specify the "file path" as the path within the repository to your file.  For example, if your manifest is at `demo/manifests/deployment.yml` in the Github repository `orgname/reponame` , specify `demo/manifests/deployment.yml`.

1. Check the "Use Default Artifact" checkbox.

1. In the "Content URL", provide the full path to the *API URI* for your manifest.  Here are some examples of this:

    * If you're using SaaS Github (www.github.com), the URI is generally formatted like this: `https://api.github.com/repos/<ORG>/<REPO>/contents/<PATH-TO-FILE>`.
      * For example: `https://api.github.com/repos/armory/demo/contents/manifests/deployment.yml`

    * If you have an on-prem Github Enterprise, then the URI may be formatted like this: `https://<GITHUB_URL>/api/v3/repos/<ORG>/<REPO>/contents/<PATH-TO-FILE>`.
      * For example: `http://github.customername.com/api/v3/repos/armory/spinnaker-pipelines/contents/manifests/deployment.yml`

1. Create a "Deploy (Manifest)" stage.  Rather than specifying the manifest directly in the UI, under the "Manifest Source" specify "Artifact", and in the "Expected Artifact" field, select the artifact you created above.

1. If you have multiple Github Accounts (credentials) added to your Spinnaker cluster, there should be a dropdown to select which one to use.

## Troubleshooting Credentials and URIs

To verify that your token and URI are correct, you can run a `curl` command to
test authentication (the `user` field doesn't matter):

```bash
curl https://api.github.com/repos/armory/demo/contents/manifests/deployment.yml \
  -u nobody:abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01
```

If you receive metadata about your file, the credential and URI are correct.
