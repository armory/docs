[Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io) is an open source, multi-cloud Continuous Delivery and Deployment platform that provides a single pane of glass with visibility across your deployment for deployment status, infrastructure, security and compliance, and metrics. By using pipelines, flexible and customizable series of deployment stages, Spinnaker can fit a variety of deployment needs. Spinnaker can deploy to and manage clusters across Amazon Web Services (AWS), Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Spinnaker not only enables businesses to move to the cloud but makes it easier for them to adopt the cloud's advantages.

[Armory Spinnaker](https://www.armory.io) is an enterprise-grade distribution of Spinnaker that forms the core of Armory's Platform. Armory's Platform helps software teams ship better software, faster. It is preconfigured and runs in your Kubernetes cluster. The platform is an extension of open source Spinnaker and includes all those benefits as well as the following:

- [Pipeline as Code (Dinghy)]({{< ref "using-dinghy" >}}) allows you to store Spinnaker pipelines in Github and manage them like you would manage code, including version control, templatization, and modularization. Spinnaker pipelines are flexible and customizable series of deployment stages. Combine all these to rapidly and repeatably scale pipelines in your Spinnaker deployment.
- [Armory Spinnaker Operator]({{< ref "operator" >}}) helps you configure, deploy, and update Spinnaker on Kubernetes clusters. If you cannot use a Kubernetes Operatork, you can use Armory Halyard to accomplish the same tasks.
- [Policy Engine]({{< ref "policy-engine" >}}) helps you meet compliance requirements based on custom policies you set.
- [Integrations](https://www.armory.io/armory-integrations/) with many of your existing tools, such as Terraform.
