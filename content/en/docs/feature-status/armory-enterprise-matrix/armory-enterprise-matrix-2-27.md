<!-- If you don't want to make markdown tables manually, use something like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#
Or you can write raw HTML :shrug: You might want to do that if you need to do bulleted lists etc inside of the table
Or a mixture of html + markdown. ## Deployment targets has an example of what this might look like

This page describes the features and capabilities that Armory supports. Note that although Spinnakerâ„¢ is part of Armory Enterprise, what Open Source Spinnaker supports and what Armory supports is not a one-to-one relationship.

> For information about the system requirements to install Armory Enterprise, see {{< linkWithTitle "system-requirements" >}}. Previously, some of that information, such as storage requirements, was listed on this page.

## As code solutions

### Pipelines as Code

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

[Pipelines as Code]({{< ref "dinghy-enable" >}}) gives you the ability to manage your pipelines and their templates in source control by creating and maintaining `dinghyfiles` that contain text representations of pipelines. These files are then ingested by Armory to generate pipelines that your app devs can use to deploy their apps.

**Templating languages**

To create `dinghyfiles`, you can use one of the following templating languages:

* HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) [![Early Access](/images/ea.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#early-release">}})
* JSON [![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}})
* YAML [![Early Access](/images/ea.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#early-release">}})

**Version control systems**

The following table lists the supported version control systems:

#### ARM CLI

The ARM CLI is a tool to render `dinghyfiles` and modules. Use it to help develop and validate your pipelines locally.

You can find the latest version on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/armory/arm-cli).

| Stage              | Armory           | Notes                 |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| [Evaluate Artifacts]({{< ref "evaluate-artifacts-stage-enable.md" >}}) | 2.24.0 and later | [![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) Available as a plugin |

## Deployment targets

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![OSS](/images/oss.svg) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

Armory supports various deployment targets.

Here's a [great chart by Google](https://cloud.google.com/docs/compare/aws#service_comparisons) to help you understand how the different deployment targets are categorized. 

### Compute as a Service

### Container as a Service Platforms

These are providers that are manifest based, so Armory applies the manifest and leaves the rollout logic to the platform itself.

| Provider           | Version | Armory         | Notes |
| -----------------  | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Kubernetes         | 1.16 or later       | All supported versions |       |
| Amazon AWS EKS     | All versions       | All supported versions |       |
| Google GKE         | All versions       | All supported versions |       |


| Provider       | Deployment strategies                      | Armory         | Notes |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Amazon AWS ECS | <ul><li>Red/Black aka Blue/Green</li></ul> | All supported versions |  AWS Public Cloud only. Armory does not support GovCloud.     |

Alternatively, you can reach our Customer Care team at [support@armory.io](mailto:support@armory.io) or visit the [Help Center](https://support.armory.io/) to submit a case. |

### Serverless

You write the function and use Armory to manage the rollout of iterative versions. These are usually hosted by Cloud Providers.

That is, Armory guarantees functionality that is compatible with open source Prometheus. Compatibility between open source Prometheus and the proprietary version is the responsibility of that vendor, not Armory. |

## Policy Engine

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

The [Policy Engine]({{< ref "policy-engine-enable" >}}) gives you the ability to ensure any Spinnaker pipeline meets certain requirements you specify.

**OPA requirements**

The Policy Engine requires an Open Policy Agent server. This can be deployed in the same cluster as Spinnaker or in an external cluster.

The following table lists the requirements:

| Requirement | Version         | Note                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPA Server  | 0.12.x or later | Specifically, the v1 API must be available. When you specify the OPA server URL in the Armory configs, include `v1` in the URL: `http://<your-opa-server>:<port>/v1`.                                                                                                                                      |

| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Save time validation | All supported versions | If no policies are set, you cannot save any pipelines until you set any policy or turn off save time validation. |
| Runtime validation   | All supported versions | If no policies are set, no policy enforcement occurs and pipelines run as they do normally.                      |
