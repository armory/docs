To use Armory Deployments, make sure you meet the following requirements.

## Armory Cloud Agent

Armory Deployments uses agents that run in target Kubernetes clusters to communicate with Armory Cloud services, specifically the Agent Hub. Make sure the [networking](#networking) requirements are met so that the Agent can communicate with the Agent Hub. 

There are no additional requirements for installing the Agent to use with Armory Deployments. 

> If you are using the Armory Agent for Spinnaker, that is a separate agent. It has its own requirements. For more information, see [those requirements]({{< ref "armory-agent-quick#before-you-begin" >}}).

## Argo Rollouts

You must have Argo Rollouts 1.x or later installed in the Kubernetes cluster you want to deploy to. For information about how to install Argo Rollout, see [Controller Installation in the Argo documentation](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/#controller-installation). Note that the Argo Rollout Controller is separate from Argo CD.

## Kubernetes

Deployment target clusters must run Kubernetes 1.16 or later.

## Networking

> Note that the Spinnaker requirements are applicable only if you use the Armory Deployments Progressive Kubernetes stage for Armory Enterprise (or Spinnaker).
