## Migrating Armory CD from Operator to Kustomize Deployment

### Introduction

This document provides step-by-step instructions for migrating your Spinnaker installation from using the Operator deployment method to a native Kubernetes deployment using Kustomize. This approach gives you more direct control over your Spinnaker resources and removes the dependency on the Operator.

Please thoroughly test this migration in a non-production environment before deploying to production.
{{% /alert %}}


#### Prerequisites

- Kubectl command-line tool installed and configured to access your cluster
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes resources (deployments, services, configmaps)
- Access to the current Spinnaker namespace

#### Migration Process Overview

1. Download current configuration files and Kubernetes resources
2. Set up Kustomize structure for native deployment
3. Remove Operator ownership from services
4. Scale down the Operator
5. Deploy using Kustomize
6. Validate the deployment
7. Remove Operator and CRDs (after confirming stability)

##### Step 1: Download Current Configuration

The script provided below will download:
- All configuration files located in /opt/spinnaker/config from each service
- All deployment, service, and statefulset YAML files for each service


###### How to Use the Download Script

1. Save the script at the bottom of this document to a file named `download_spinnaker_configs.sh`
2. Make the script executable:
`chmod +x download_spinnaker_configs.sh`
3. Run the script with your Spinnaker namespace:
`./download_spinnaker_configs.sh your-spinnaker-namespace`
4. The script will create an operator-migration directory containing all needed files

###### What Gets Downloaded

- **Deployments:** YAML files for each service deployment
- **Services:** YAML files for all Spinnaker services
- **StatefulSets:** YAML files for any statefulsets (like front50)
- **Configuration Files:** All files from /opt/spinnaker/config in each pod

##### Step 2: Set Up Kustomize Structure

Create a Kustomize directory structure for your Spinnaker deployment:
1. Move the downloaded deployments and services to their respective directories
2. Create configmaps from the downloaded configuration files
3. Set up the kustomization.yaml files

{{% alert color="warning" title="Tip" %}}
You can use the GitHub - spinnaker/spinnaker-kustomize: Spinnaker installation via kustomize  as a reference for Kustomize structure
{{% /alert %}}

##### Step 3: Remove Operator Ownership from Services

This step detaches the Operator's control while keeping services running.
1. Identify resources owned by the Operator:
`kubectl get all -n your-spinnaker-namespace -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.metadata.ownerReferences[]? | .apiVersion=="spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2" and .kind=="SpinnakerService") | {name: .metadata.name, kind: .kind}'`
2. Remove ownership references using patch commands:
`kubectl patch deployment spin-deck -n your-spinnaker-namespace --type json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/ownerReferences"}]'`
3. Repeat for all resources with Operator ownership
{{% alert color="warning" title="Note" %}}
This breaks the connection between the Operator and services but keeps everything running
{{% /alert %}}

##### Step 4: Verify Ownership Removal

Confirm that no resources are still owned by the Operator:
`kubectl get all -n your-spinnaker-namespace -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.metadata.ownerReferences[]? | .apiVersion=="spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2" and .kind=="SpinnakerService") | {name: .metadata.name, kind: .kind}'`
The command should return empty if all ownership references have been removed.

##### Step 5: Extra Precautions Before Deployment
Compare current resources with your Kustomize configurations:
`kubectl diff -f <(kustomize build ./overlays/prod)`

Review the differences carefully. Look for:
- Immutable field changes (might require special handling)
- Configuration changes that could affect service behavior
- Missing resources that should be included

###### Perform a Dry Run

Test your deployment without actually applying changes:
`kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f <(kustomize build ./overlays/prod)`

##### Step 6: Scale Down the Operator
Prevent the Operator from interfering with your deployment:
`kubectl scale deployment spinnaker-operator -n your-spinnaker-namespace --replicas=0`

##### Step 7: Deploy Using Kustomize

Apply your Kustomize configurations:

`kubectl apply -f <(kustomize build ./overlays/prod)`

##### Step 8: Validate and Monitor
1. Check that all pods are running:
`kubectl get pods -n your-spinnaker-namespace` 
2. Verify Spinnaker services are accessible:
    - Access the Spinnaker UI 
    - Test a simple pipeline 
    - Check integrations are working
3. Monitor the environment for stability over the next few days

##### Step 9: Remove Operator and CRDs

Once stability is confirmed (at least 24 hours later):
1. Remove the Operator CRDs:
`kubectl delete crd spinnakerservices.spinnaker.armory.io`
2. Remove the Operator deployment if still present:
`kubectl delete deployment spinnaker-operator -n your-spinnaker-namespace`


##### Rollback Plan
If issues arise during migration:
1. Scale up the Operator:
`kubectl scale deployment spinnaker-operator -n your-spinnaker-namespace --replicas=1`
2. Reapply the previous SpinnakerService resource:
`kubectl apply -f original-spinnakerservice.yaml`
3. Allow the Operator to reconcile and restore the previous state
