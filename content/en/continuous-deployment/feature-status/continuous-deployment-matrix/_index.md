## Compatibility matrix overview

This compatibility matrix details what is supported in the **Armory Continuous Deployment {{< param "version" >}}** release. Compatibility is for all minor versions of a major release version. Note that although Spinnakerâ„¢ is part of Armory Continuous Deployment, what open source Spinnaker supports and what Armory Continuous Deployment supports is not a one-to-one relationship.

You can find the compatibility matrix for previous Armory Continuous Deployment releases in the docs version for the release you are using:

* [Armory Continuous Deployment v2.28 compatibility matrix](https://v2-28.docs.armory.io/continuous-deployment/feature-status/continuous-deployment-matrix/)  
* [Armory Continuous Deployment v2.27 compatibility matrix](https://v2-27.docs.armory.io/armory-enterprise/feature-status/armory-enterprise-matrix/)  
* [Armory Continuous Deployment v2.26 compatibility matrix](https://v2-26.docs.armory.io/docs/feature-status/armory-enterprise-matrix/)

<!-- If you don't want to make markdown tables manually, use something like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#
Or you can write raw HTML :shrug: You might want to do that if you need to do bulleted lists etc inside of the table
Or a mixture of html + markdown. ## Deployment targets has an example of what this might look like

### Terraform Integration

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

Use Terraform within your pipelines to create your infrastructure as part of your software delivery pipeline. Terraform Integration is a feature in Armory CD and a plugin for Spinnaker. For more information see the [Terrafrom Integration docs]({{< ref "plugins/terraform/_index.md" >}}).

**Supported Terraform versions**

{{< include "plugins/terraform/terraform-versions.md" >}}

**Features**

{{< include "plugins/terraform/features.md" >}}

Support is limited to configuring Terraform Integration and using the stage within Armory Continuous Deployment. Armory's Customer Care team does not troubleshoot Terraform script issues or infrastructure creation using Terraform. If you have questions, contact your assigned Technical Account Manager and/or Account Executive. Alternatively, you can reach our Customer Care team by visiting the [Armory Support Portal](https://support.armory.io/) to [submit a case](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010136).
