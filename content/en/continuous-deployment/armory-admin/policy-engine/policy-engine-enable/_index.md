## Overview of the Policy Engine

Armory's Policy Engine helps you meet compliance requirements based on custom policies you set. You can configure the Policy Engine to verify that your pipelines meet certain requirements at save time or at runtime. You can use the Policy Engine with Armory Continuous Deployment (Armory CD) and open source Spinnaker.

## {{% heading "prereq" %}}

* The Policy Engine requires an [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) server, version 0.12.x or later. You can either use the example on this page to deploy a server in the same Kubernetes cluster as Armory Continuous Deployment or see the OPA documentation for information about how to [deploy an OPA server](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/deployments/). Specifically, the OPA v1 API must be available.
* You must be using a Armory Continuous Deployment or Spinnaker [version]{{< ref "continuous-deployment-matrix#policy-engine" >}} that supports the Policy Engine.


## Deploy an OPA server

The Policy Engine supports the following OPA server deployments:

* An OPA server deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster as an Armory CD or Spinnaker deployment. The [Using ConfigMaps for OPA policies](#using-configmaps-for-opa-policies) section contains a ConfigMap you can use.
* An OPA cluster that is **not** in the same Kubernetes cluster as an Armory CD or Spinnaker deployment . See the [OPA documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) for more information about installing an OPA server in a separate cluster.

### Using ConfigMaps for Open Policy Agent policies

If you want to use ConfigMaps for OPA policies, you can use the following manifest as a starting point. This example manifest deploys an OPA server and applies the configuration for things like rolebinding and a static DNS. When using the example, keep the following guidelines in mind:

* The manifest does not configure any authorization requirements for the OPA server it deploys. This means that anyone can add a policy.
* The manifest deploys the OPA server to a namespace called `opa`.
* The OPA server uses the following config: `"--require-policy-label=true"`. This configures the OPA server to look for a specific label so that it does not check all configmaps for new policies. For information about how to apply the relevant label to your policy configmaps, see [Creating a policy]({{< ref "policy-engine-use#step-2-add-the-policy-to-your-opa-server" >}}).
