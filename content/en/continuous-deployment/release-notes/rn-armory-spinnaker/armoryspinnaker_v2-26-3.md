- Major changes or new features we want to call out for Armory and OSS. Changes should be grouped under end user understandable sections. For example, instead of Deck, use UI. Instead of Fiat, use Permissions.
- Fixes to any known issues from previous versions that we have in release notes. These can all be grouped under a Fixed issues H3.

### AWS Lambda

* Fixed an issue where infrastructure for Lambda functions was not being displayed in the UI. This was related to Lambda functions and their event source mappings.
