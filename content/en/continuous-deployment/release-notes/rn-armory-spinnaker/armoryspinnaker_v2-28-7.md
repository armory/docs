## Security

Armory scans the codebase as we develop and release software. Contact your Armory account representative for information about CVE scans for this release.

## Early access features enabled by default

### Automatically cancel Jenkins jobs

You now have the ability to cancel triggered Jenkins jobs when a Spinnaker pipeline is canceled, giving you more control over your full Jenkins workflow. Learn more about Jenkins + Spinnaker in this [Spinnaker changelog](https://spinnaker.io/changelogs/1.29.0-changelog/#orca).

### Enhanced BitBucket Server pull request handling

Trigger Spinnaker pipelines natively when pull requests are opened in BitBucket with newly added events including PR opened, deleted, and declined. See [Triggering pipelines with Bitbucket Server](https://spinnaker.io/docs/guides/user/pipeline/triggers/bitbucket-events/) in the Spinnaker docs for details

### Pipelines adapt to sub pipeline with manual judgment color

When a child/sub pipeline is running and requires a manual judgment, the parent pipeline provides a visual representation that the child pipeline has an manual judgement waiting. This [Github pull request](https://github.com/spinnaker/deck/pull/9863) shows a visual representation of the feature in action.

## Early access features enabled manually

### Dynamic rollback timeout

To make the dynamic timeout available, you need to enable the feature flag in Orca and Deck. You need to add this block to `orca.yml` file if you want to enable the dynamic rollback timeout feature:

```yaml
rollback:
  timeout:
    enabled: true
```

On the Orca side, the feature flag overrides the default value rollback timeout - 5 min - with a UI input from the user.

On the Deck side, the feature flag enhances the Rollback Cluster stage UI with timeout input.

`window.spinnakerSettings.feature.dynamicRollbackTimeout = true;`

The default is used if there is no value set in the UI.

### Pipelines-as-Code PR checks

This feature, when enabled, verifies if the author of a commit that changed app parameters has sufficient WRITE permission for that app. You can specify a list of authors whose permissions are not valid. This option’s purpose is to skip permissions checks for bots and tools.

See [Permissions check for a commit]({{< ref "plugins/pipelines-as-code/install/configure#permissions-check-for-a-commit" >}}) for details.

### Pipelines-as-Code multi-branch enhancement

Now you can configure Pipeline-as-Code to pull Pipelines-as-Code files from multiple branches on the same repo. Cut out the tedious task of managing multiple repos; have a single repo for Spinnaker application pipelines. See [Multiple branches]({{<  ref "plugins/pipelines-as-code/install/configure#multiple-branches" >}}) for how to enable and configure this feature.

### Terraform template fix

Armory fixed an issue with SpEL expression failures appearing while using Terraformer to serialize data from a Terraform Plan execution. With this feature flag fix enabled, you are able to use the Terraform template file provider. Open a support ticket if you need this fix.

## Highlighted updates

<!--
Each item category (such as UI) under here should be an h3 (###). List the following info that service owners should be able to provide:
- Major changes or new features we want to call out for Armory and OSS. Changes should be grouped under end user understandable sections. For example, instead of Deck, use UI. Instead of Fiat, use Permissions.
- Fixes to any known issues from previous versions that we have in release notes. These can all be grouped under a Fixed issues H3.
-->

### Clouddriver
* Addressed an issue where deploying to an ECS cluster with tags was failing

### Orca
* Fixed an issue where Blue/Green(Red/Black) in the non-default namespace for kubernetes was failing
* Fixed an issue where a missing “namespace” attribute in a HTTP call was being sent while fetching manifest details from Clouddriver. 

### Deck
* Fixed some bugs related to Clone CX when instance types are incompatible. For full details, visit the [Github PR](https://github.com/spinnaker/deck/pull/9901#issue-1435271029)
