## 2021/07/22 Release Notes

> Note: If you're experiencing production issues after upgrading Spinnaker, rollback to a previous working version and please report issues to [http://go.armory.io/support](http://go.armory.io/support).

For information about what Armory supports for this version, see the [Armory Continuous Deployment v2.26 compatibility matrix](https://v2-26.docs.armory.io/docs/feature-status/armory-enterprise-matrix/).

## Required Halyard or Operator version

To install, upgrade, or configure Armory 2.26.0, use one of the following tools:

- Armory-extended Halyard 1.12 or later
  - 2.26.x is the last minor release that you can use Halyard to install or manage. Future releases require the Armory Operator. For more information, see [Halyard Deprecation]({{< ref "halyard-deprecation" >}}).

- Armory Operator 1.2.6 or later

   For information about upgrading, Operator, see [Upgrade the Operator]({{< ref "op-manage-operator#upgrade-the-operator" >}}).

## Security

Armory scans the codebase as we develop and release software. Contact your Armory account representative for information about CVE scans for this release.

## Upcoming potential breaking change

{{< include "breaking-changes/bc-java-tls-mysql.md" >}}

## Breaking changes
<!-- Copy/paste from the previous version if there are recent ones. We can drop breaking changes after 3 minor versions. Add new ones from OSS and Armory. -->

> Breaking changes are kept in this list for 3 minor versions from when the change is introduced. For example, a breaking change introduced in 2.21.0 appears in the list up to and including the 2.24.x releases. It would not appear on 2.25.x release notes.

#### Suffixes for the Kubernetes Run Job stage

The `kubernetes.jobs.append-suffix` parameter no longer works. The removal of this parameter was previously announced as part of a [breaking change]({{< ref "armoryspinnaker_v2-22-0/#suffix-no-longer-added-to-jobs-created-by-kubernetes-run-job-stage" >}}) in Armory 2.22.

To continue adding a random suffix to jobs created by the Kubernetes Run Job stage, use the `metadata.generateName` field in your Kubernetes job manifests. For more information, see [Generated values](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#generated-values).

## Highlighted updates

### AWS Cloudwatch

You can now configure the Kayenta service to assume a role when connecting to AWS Cloudwatch:

```yaml
kayenta:
  aws:
    enabled: true
    accounts:
      - name: monitoring
        region: <your-region>
        iamRoleArn: <your-role-ARN> # For example arn:aws:iam::042225624470:role/theRole
        # iamRoleExternalId: Optional. For example 12345
        iamRoleArnTarget: <your-role-ARN-target> # For example arn:aws:iam::042225624470:role/targetcloudwatchaccount
        # iamRoleExternalIdTarget: <your-ExternalID> # Optional. For example 84475
        supportedTypes:
          - METRICS_STORE        
```

### Pipelines-as-Code

#### Ignore file

Pipelines-as-Code now supports using an ignore file for GitHub repos to ignore certain files in a repo that it watches. To use this feature, create a file named `.dinghyignore` in the root directory of the repo.

You can add specific filenames, filepaths, or glob-style paths. For example, the following `.dinghyignore` file ignores the file named `README.md`, all the files in the `milton` directory, and all `.pdf` files:

```
README.md
milton/
*.pdf
```

#### JSON validation

In 2.26.0, strict JSON validation was on by default. In 2.26.1, it is now configurable as a boolean in `spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles.dinghy.jsonValidationDisabled`:


```yaml
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      dinghy:
        jsonValidationDisabled: <boolean>
```

The config is optional. If omitted, strict validation is on by default.

> When strict validation is on, existing pipelines may fail if any JSON is invalid.

#### pipelineID

Fixed an issue where the `pipelineID` function did not work, leading to situations where pipelines did not get updated after a change.

###  Spinnaker Community Contributions

There have also been numerous enhancements, fixes, and features across all of Spinnaker's other services. See the
[Spinnaker v1.26.6](https://www.spinnaker.io/changelogs/1.26.6-changelog/) changelog for details.
