-->

## 2025-08-14 release notes

>Note: If you experience production issues after upgrading Armory Continuous Deployment, roll back to a previous working version and report issues to [http://go.armory.io/support](http://go.armory.io/support).

## Required Armory Operator version

To install, upgrade, or configure Armory CD 2.36.2, use Armory Operator 1.8.6 or later.

## Security

Armory scans the codebase as we develop and release software. Contact your Armory account representative for information about CVE scans for this release.

## Breaking changes
<!-- Copy/paste from the previous version if there are recent ones. We can drop breaking changes after 3 minor versions. Add new ones from OSS and Armory. -->

The following configuration properties have been restructured:

Previous Configuration:

```yaml
tasks:
  days-of-execution-history:  
  number-of-old-pipeline-executions-to-include:
```

New configuration format

```yaml
tasks:
  controller:
    days-of-execution-history:
    number-of-old-pipeline-executions-to-include:
    optimize-execution-retrieval: <boolean>
    max-execution-retrieval-threads:
    max-number-of-pipeline-executions-to-process:
    execution-retrieval-timeout-seconds:
```

These changes improve query performance and execution retrieval efficiency, particularly for large-scale pipeline applications.

## Known issues
<!-- Copy/paste known issues from the previous version if they're not fixed. Add new ones from OSS and Armory. If there aren't any issues, state that so readers don't think we forgot to fill out this section. -->

### Echo Filter enabled pipelines feature 
Spinnaker OSS Version 1.31.0 introduced a feature to filter pipelines from front50 , that was disabled by default.
Version 1.35.0 enabled it by default , which is not recommended and can cause issues with automated triggers.
In Armory CD 2.36.2 we recommend to explicitly disable this feature by setting the following configuration:

```
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      echo:
        pipelineCache:
          filterFront50Pipelines: false 
```

## Highlighted updates

### Armory Continuous Deployment 2.36.2 Docker images now based on Ubuntu
The Armory Continuous Deployment 2.36.2 Docker images have been updated to use Ubuntu as the base image, replacing the previous Alpine base.
This change enhances compatibility with various libraries and tools, improving overall stability and performance.
Additionally, the new images now include all the necessary dependencies for authentication on a Kebreros server.

### Pipeline Reference feature is now able to Lazy load the pipeline reference pipelines
In Spinnaker OSS release 1.35.0 Orca introduced a feature flag to reduce the execution size in nested pipelines by 
converting PipelineTrigger to PipelineRefTrigger:
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=12-13" >}}
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      orca:
        executionRepository:
          sql:
            enabled: true
            pipelineRef:
              enabled: true
{{< /highlight >}}

When enabled, child pipeline execution ids are stored in sql instead of the entire child pipeline execution context.

In Armory CD 2.36.2 this functionality is now extended to make the in-memory representation of the pipelines aware of the pipeline reference 
and to not load in-memory a full representation of the pipeline context. To enable this feature in Deck add the following in `settings-local.js`:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=11" >}}
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      deck:
        settings-local.js: |
          ...
          window.spinnakerSettings.feature.pipelineRefEnabled = true;
          ...
{{< /highlight >}}

*Orca [PR 4842](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4842)*
*Deck [PR 10164](https://github.com/spinnaker/deck/pull/10164)*

### New pipeline stage configuration `backOffPeriodMs`
A new configuration option `backOffPeriodMs` has been added to the pipeline stage configuration. This option allows users
to specify a back-off period in milliseconds for stages that may need to retry operations after a failure. Before this,
pipeline authors had no control over the backoff period. It came from either spinnaker configuration properties or
implementations of RetryableTask.getDynamicBackoffPeriod.

Additionally, the following configuration options have been added that allow admins to specify globablly the backoff period:
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=9-11" >}}
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      orca:
        tasks.global.backOffPeriod:
        tasks.<cloud provider>.backOffPeriod:
        tasks.<cloud provider>.<account name>.backOffPeriod:
{{< /highlight >}}

*Orca [PR 4841](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4841)*

### Java upgrades

Java 17 is now the default source and target. Java 11 support has been removed entirely. Please note you may need to add the following JAVA_OPTS options: `--add-exports=java.base/sun.security.x509=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports=java.base/sun.security.pkcs=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports=java.base/sun.security.rsa=ALL-UNNAMED` to clouddriver if using GCP accounts due to credentials parsing of certificates. These can set in the [service-settings config](https://spinnaker.io/docs/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-service-settings) . These configs are likely to be added to the defaults in all future releases

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=10" >}}
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    service-settings:
      clouddriver:
        env:
          JAVA_OPTS: "--add-exports=java.base/sun.security.x509=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports=java.base/sun.security.pkcs=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports=java.base/sun.security.rsa=ALL-UNNAMED"
{{< /highlight >}}

### Performance Improvements for Pipeline Executions

This release includes several optimizations to improve pipeline execution times, particularly for complex pipeline structures.

Key Improvements

1. Memorize the `anyUpstreamStagesFailed` extension function to improve time complexity from exponential to linear
2. Optimize `getAncestorsImpl` to reduce time complexity by a factor of N, where N is the number of stages in a pipeline
3. Optimize `StartStageHandler` to only call withAuth (which calls getAncestorsImpl) when

These enhancements significantly reduce pipeline execution time, with the most notable gains observed in dense pipeline graphs. For example, in the `ComplexPipeline.kt` test scenario, execution time improved from not completing at all to approximately `160ms`.

*[PR 4824](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4824)*

### Performance Improvements for SQL Backend

This release enhances the performance of SQL-backed pipeline queries by optimizing database operations, particularly for the API call:

```
/applications/{application}/pipelines?expand=false&limit=2
```

which is frequently initiated by Deck and forwarded through Gate to Orca.

Key Improvements

- Improved Query Efficiency: Optimized the retrieval of pipeline execution data, significantly reducing database query times.
- Refactored `TaskController`: Externalized configuration properties to allow better flexibility and tuning.
- Enhanced `getPipelinesForApplication()`
  - Limits the number of pipeline config IDs queried.
  - Processes multiple pipeline config IDs simultaneously.
  - Introduces multi-threading to handle batches efficiently.

*[PR 4804](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4804)*

### Feature: Read Connection Pool for SQL Execution Repository

This release introduces support for a dedicated read connection pool for specific read-only database queries in `SqlExecutionRepository`

Key Improvements

1. New "read" Connection Pool: Allows read operations to be routed to a separate connection pool.
2. Configurable Read Pool: Users can define an additional read connection pool in the SQL configuration.
3. Ensures Data Consistency: Some read queries still rely on recently written data and are not yet converted to use a read replica due to potential replication lag.

Configuration Example

To enable the read connection pool, add the following configuration:
```yaml
sql:
  connectionPools:
    default:
      <...>
    read:
      jdbcUrl: jdbc:...
      user: orca_service
      password:
      connectionTimeoutMs:
      validationTimeoutMs:
      maxPoolSize:
      minIdle:
      maxLifetimeMs:
      idleTimeoutMs:
```

*[PR 4803](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4803)*

### Enhanced pipeline batch update feature

#### Gate

Adds a new enpdoint, `POST /pipelines/bulksave`, which can take a list of pipeline configurations to save. The endpoint will return a response that indicates how many of the saves were successful, how many failed, and what the failures are. The structure is

```
[
   "successful_pipelines_count"  : <int>,
   "successful_pipelines"        : <List<String>>,
   "failed_pipelines_count"      : <int>,
   "failed_pipelines"            : <List<Map<String, Object>>>
]
```

There are a few config knobs which control some bulk save functionality. The gate endpoint invokes an orca asynchronous process to manage saving the pipelines and polls until the orca operations are complete.

```yaml
controller:
  pipeline:
    bulksave:
      # the max number of times gate will poll orca to check for task status
      max-polls-for-task-completion: <int>
      # the interval at which gate will poll orca.
      taskCompletionCheckIntervalMs: <int>
```

#### Orca

Updates Orcaâ€™s SavePipelineTask to support bulk saves using the updated functionality in the front50 bulk save endpoint.

With [Orca PR 4781](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4781), keys from the stage contextâ€™s outputs section can now be removed (there by reducing the context size significantly). At present the following tasks support this feature:

* PromoteManifestKatoOutputsTask
* WaitOnJobCompletionTask
* ResolveDeploySourceManifestTask
* BindProducedArtifactsTask


The [Orca PR 4788](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4788) introduced a new CheckIfApplicationExists task that is added to various pipeline stages to check if the application defined in the pipeline stage context is known to front50 and/or clouddriver. The following config knobs are provided so that all of these stages can be individually configured to not perform this check if needed. Default value is set to false for all of them.

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=9-28" >}}
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      orca:
        tasks:
          clouddriver:
            promoteManifestKatoOutputsTask:
              excludeKeysFromOutputs:
              - outputs.createdArtifacts
              - outputs.manifests
              - outputs.boundArtifacts
            waitOnJobCompletionTask:
              excludeKeysFromOutputs:
              - jobStatus
              - completionDetails
            resolveDeploySourceManifestTask:
              excludeKeysFromOutputs:
              - manifests
              - requiredArtifacts
              - optionalArtifacts
          core:
            bindProducedArtifactsTask:
              excludeKeysFromOutputs:
              - artifacts
{{< /highlight >}}

Separate config knobs are also provided at the AbstractCheckIfApplicationExistsTask level to determine if clouddriver needs to be queried for the application or not. It is by default set to true, so it is an opt-out capability. the config property is:

```yaml
tasks:
  clouddriver:
    checkIfApplicationExistsTask:
      checkClouddriver: false   # default is true
```

This feature runs in audit mode by default which means if checkIfApplicationExistsTask finds no application, a warning message is logged. But when audit mode is disabled through the following property, pipelines fail if application is not found:

```yaml
tasks:
  clouddriver:
    checkIfApplicationExistsTask:
      auditModeEnabled: false  # default is true
```

#### Front50

Batch update operation in front50 is now atomic. Deserialization issues are addressed.
Configurable controls are added to decide whether cache should be refreshed while checking for duplicate pipelines:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=9-12" >}}
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    profiles:
      front50:
        controller:
          pipeline:
            save:
              refreshCacheOnDuplicatesCheck: false // default is true
{{< /highlight >}}

Batch update call now responds with a status of succeeded and failed pipelines info. The response will be a map containing information in the following format:

```
[
  "successful_pipelines_count"  : <int>,
  "successful_pipelines"        : <List<String>>,
  "failed_pipelines_count"      : <int>,
  "failed_pipelines"            : <List<Map<String, Object>>>
]
```

Here the value for `successful_pipelines` is the list of successful pipeline names whereas the value for `failed_pipelines` is the list of failed pipelines expressed as maps.


<!--
Each item category (such as UI) under here should be an h3 (###). List the following info that service owners should be able to provide:
- Major changes or new features we want to call out for Armory and OSS. Changes should be grouped under end user understandable sections. For example, instead of Deck, use UI. Instead of Fiat, use Permissions.
- Fixes to any known issues from previous versions that we have in release notes. These can all be grouped under a Fixed issues H3.
