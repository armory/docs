## Minimum Operator version

To install, upgrade, and configure Armory Continuous Deployment (Armory CD), ensure that you are running at least the minimum Operator version for your release:

| Armory CD version | Minimum Operator version |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 2.30.x            | 1.8.6                    |
| 2.28.x            | 1.6.0                    |
| 2.27.x            | 1.4.0                    |


## LTS releases

Starting with version 2.27.1, Armory CD follows a Long Term Support (LTS) release model where there are two LTS releases per year. Major features and changes are packaged into an LTS release.

Each LTS is supported for at least 1 year from its release date. During the supported lifetime of an LTS release, Armory ships patch releases for the LTS that include improvements like CVE remediation, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
