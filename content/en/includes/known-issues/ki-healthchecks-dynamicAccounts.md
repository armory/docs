#### Failing health checks when using dynamic accounts 
<!-- BOB-30122 -->

There is a known issue where the health checks for the Clouddriver pod fail when the following conditions are true:

* Spinnaker is configured to use Spring Cloud Config Dynamic Accounts backed by Vault using a K/V Secrets Engine v2.
* Spinnaker is configured to use Armory Vault Secrets.

The health check failure prevents Kubernetes from transitioning the Clouddriver pod to a ready and active state, which prevents Kubernetes from passing traffic to the Clouddriver pod.

**Workaround**

As an alternative to the default HTTP health check, use TCP probe. 

If deploying with Halyard, add the following to `clouddriver-local.yml`:

```yaml
kubernetes:
  useTcpProbe: true
```

If you use the Spinnaker Operator, include the following setting:

```yaml
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    service-settings:
      clouddriver:
        kubernetes:
          useTcpProbe: true
```

**Affected versions**: 2.23.4, 2.23.5
