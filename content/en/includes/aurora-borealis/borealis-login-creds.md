The login credentials you use when you run the Borealis CLI locally and need to authenticate yourself to Armory's hosted services (such as when you run the `login` command with the Borealis CLI). 

Every user who wants to deploy to your clusters using Borealis must have an account. For information about inviting users, see [blah]

This is also your login for Armory's hosted cloud services UI (where you can perform tasks such as managing credentials) and the Status UI (where you can monitor the progress of your deployments). 

1. Register for Armory's hosted cloud services with the link that Armory provides.
2. Click **Sign Up** and complete the form.
3. Complete the two-factor authentication configuration.
