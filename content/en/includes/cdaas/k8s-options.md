CD-as-a-Service does not provide you with a Kubernetes cluster. There are several options you can use to get a cluster quickly if you need to:

* [Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/) -  A SaaS cluster. Your cluster should have 3 **Shared CPU** nodes of type **Linode 2GB**.
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) - A simple cluster installed on your computer (requires Docker).
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) - A simple cluster installed on your computer.
