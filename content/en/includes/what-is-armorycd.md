Armory helps software teams ship better software, faster. Armory Continuous Deployment (Armory CD) is an enterprise-grade distribution of Spinnakerâ„¢ that runs in your Kubernetes cluster. Armory CD is an extension of open source Spinnaker and includes all of those benefits as well as the following:

- [Pipelines as Code (Dinghy)]({{< ref "using-dinghy" >}}) allows you to store Spinnaker pipelines in Github and manage them like you would manage code, including version control, templatization, and modularization. Spinnaker pipelines are flexible and customizable series of deployment stages. Combine all these to rapidly and repeatably scale pipelines in your Spinnaker deployment.
- [Policy Engine]({{< ref "policy-engine" >}}) helps you meet compliance requirements based on custom policies you set. You can configure the Policy Engine to verify that your pipelines meet certain requirements at save time or at runtime. You can use the Policy Engine with Armory Continuous Deployment (Armory CD) and open source Spinnaker.
- [Terraform integration]({{< ref "terraform-use-integration" >}}) allows you to use your existing Terraform scripts to plan and create infrastructure as part a Spinnaker pipeline. You can deploy your application and infrastructure all in a single pipeline.
- Integrations with many of your existing tools. For a full list, see [Integrations](https://www.armory.io/armory-spinnaker/integrations/).
