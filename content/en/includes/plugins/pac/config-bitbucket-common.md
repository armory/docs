You need to set up webhooks for each project that has the `dinghyfile` or module separately. Make the webhook `POST` to: `https://spinnaker.your-company.com:8084/webhooks/git/bitbucket`. If you're using Stash `<v3.11.6`, you need to install the [webhook plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.stash.plugin.stash-web-post-receive-hooks-plugin/server/overview) to be able to set up webhooks.
