Before configuring your repos, ensure you have the following:

1. A personal access token that has read access to the repo where you store your `dinghyfile` and the repo where you store `module` files.
1. The organization where the app repos and templates reside. For example, if your repo is `armory-io/dinghy-templates`, your `template-org` would be `armory-io`.
1. The name of the repo containing your modules. For example, if your repo is `armory-io/dinghy-templates`, your `template-repo` would be `dinghy-templates`.
