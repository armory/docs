You need to create and install a GitHub App that interacts with the GitHub Integration plugin. 

1. Create a GitHub App. Follow the instructions in GitHub's [Registering a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) guide. 

   * Provide values for **GitHub App name**. **Homepage URL**, and **Repository permissions**. You _do not_ need to fill out the **Identifying and authorizing users**, **Post installation**, or **Webhook** sections.
   * Your GitHub App should have the following **Repository permissions**:
 
     * **Actions**: `Read and write`
     * **Contents**: `Read and write`
     * **Deployments**: `Read and write`
     * **Environments**: `Read and write`
     * **Metadata**: `Read-only`

   * You do need to generate a private key (**Private keys** section).
   * Be sure to note the GitHub App's **App ID** and **Private key**. You need these to configure the GitHub Integration plugin.

1. Install the GitHub App you created either in a specific repo or organization-wide. Follow the instructions in GitHub's [Installing your own GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-your-own-github-app) guide.
