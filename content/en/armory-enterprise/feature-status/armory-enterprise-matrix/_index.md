## Compatibility matrix overview

This compatibility matrix details what is supported in the **Armory Enterprise {{< param "version" >}}** release. Compatibility is for all minor versions of a major release version. Note that although Spinnakerâ„¢ is part of Armory Enterprise, what open source Spinnaker supports and what Armory Enterprise supports is not a one-to-one relationship.

You can find the compatibility matrix for previous Armory Enterprise releases in the docs version for the release you are using:

* [Armory Enterprise v2.26 compatibility matrix](https://v2-26.docs.armory.io/docs/feature-status/armory-enterprise-matrix/)
* [Armory Enterprise v2.25 compatibility matrix](https://v2-25.docs.armory.io/docs/armory-enterprise-matrix/)
* [Armory Enterprise v2.24 compatibility matrix](https://v2-24.docs.armory.io/docs/armory-platform-matrix/)   

>See {{< linkWithTitle "system-requirements" >}} for information about the system requirements you need to install Armory Enterprise.

<!-- If you don't want to make markdown tables manually, use something like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#
Or you can write raw HTML :shrug: You might want to do that if you need to do bulleted lists etc inside of the table
Or a mixture of html + markdown. ## Deployment targets has an example of what this might look like

## As code solutions

### Pipelines as Code

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

[Pipelines as Code]({{< ref "dinghy-enable" >}}) gives you the ability to manage your pipelines and their templates in source control by creating and maintaining `dinghyfiles` that contain text representations of pipelines. These files are then ingested by Armory Enterprise to generate pipelines that your app devs can use to deploy their apps.

**Templating languages**

To create `dinghyfiles`, you can use one of the following templating languages:

* HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) [![Early Access](/images/ea.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#early-release">}})
* JSON [![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}})
* YAML [![Early Access](/images/ea.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#early-release">}})

**Version control systems**

The following table lists the supported version control systems:

| BitBucket Cloud  |                             | All supported versions |                 |

#### ARM CLI

The ARM CLI is a tool to render `dinghyfiles` and modules. Use it to help develop and validate your pipelines locally.

You can find the latest version on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/armory/arm-cli).


### Terraform Integration

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

Terraform Integration gives you the ability to use Terraform within your pipelines to create your infrastructure as part of your software delivery pipeline.

**Supported Terraform versions**

The following table lists the supported Terraform versions:

| Terraform Versions | Armory Enterprise Version                 | Note |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ---- |

Support is limited to configuring Terraform Integration and using the stage within Armory Enterprise. Armory's Customer Care team does not troubleshoot Terraform script issues or infrastructure creation using Terraform. If you have questions, contact your assigned Technical Account Manager and/or Account Executive. Alternatively, you can reach our Customer Care team by visiting the [Armory Support Portal](https://support.armory.io/) to [submit a case](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010136).

## Deployment targets

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![OSS](/images/oss.svg) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

Armory Enterprise supports various deployment targets.

Here's a [great chart by Google](https://cloud.google.com/docs/compare/aws#service_comparisons) to help you understand how the different deployment targets are categorized.

### Compute as a Service

That is, Armory guarantees functionality that is compatible with open source Prometheus. Compatibility between open source Prometheus and the proprietary version is the responsibility of that vendor, not Armory. |

## Policy Engine

[![Generally available](/images/ga.svg)]({{< ref "release-definitions#ga" >}}) ![Proprietary](/images/proprietary.svg)

The [Policy Engine]({{< ref "policy-engine-enable" >}}) gives you the ability to ensure any pipeline meets certain requirements that you specify.

**OPA requirements**

The Policy Engine requires an Open Policy Agent server. This can be deployed in the same cluster as Armory Enterprise or in an external cluster.

The following table lists the requirements:

| Requirement | Version         | Note                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPA Server  | 0.12.x or later | Specifically, the v1 API must be available. When you specify the OPA server URL in the Armory Enterprise configs, include `v1` in the URL: `http://<your-opa-server>:<port>/v1`.                                                                                                                                      |

**Supported validations**

| Validation           | Armory Enterprise Version                 | Note                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Save time validation | All supported versions | If no policies are set, you cannot save any pipelines until you set any policy or turn off save time validation. |
| Runtime validation   | All supported versions | If no policies are set, no policy enforcement occurs and pipelines run as they do normally.                      |

## Secret stores
