## What is Quick Spin?
Quick Spin is a containerized Armory CD instance that you install with a single shell command. You can use this minimal instance to evaluate the Armory CD Self-Hosted product.

Once you have Quick Spin running, you can use it to evaluate Armory CD Self Hosted and to learn how to use Spinnaker. You can also use Quick Spin to test out Spinnaker features and to learn how to configure Spinnaker. 

Included with the Quick Spin container is a sample application and three sample pipelines that you can use to test out Spinnaker. After installing Quick Spin, you can use the sample application and pipelines to test out Spinnaker features.


> The Quick Spin container is not intended for production use.
