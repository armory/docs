## Kayenta Overview

Kayenta is the Spinnaker service that performs Automated Canary Analysis (ACA). The goal of Kayenta is to provide the end user with confidence that a deployment is safe through automation and intelligence. For information about how to use Canary deployments, see {{< linkWithTitle "kayenta-canary-use" >}}.

## Configure Kayenta

The open source Spinnaker documentation has a good overview of how to
configure Kayenta using Halyard at
[Set up canary support](https://www.spinnaker.io/setup/canary/).

For Operator, the following example is an equivalent `SpinnakerService` manifest. The example config uses Datadog as the metrics provider and stores canary configs and analysis in a GCS bucket:

> For information about how to configure other providers see [Canary Config]({{< ref "canary-op-config" >}}) unless you use Dynatrace or AWS CloudWatch. If you use one of those as the metrics provider, see [Use Canary Analysis with Dynatrace]({{< ref "kayenta-canary-dynatrace" >}}) or [Use Canary Analysis with AWS CloudWatch]({{< ref "kayenta-canary-cloudwatch" >}}).
