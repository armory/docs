## Requirements and guidelines for using Fiat

* Armory 2.17 (Open Source Spinnaker<sup>TM</sup> 1.17) or later
* Fiat must be enabled and configured to work with an identity provider. For more information, see [Authorization (RBAC)](https://www.spinnaker.io/setup/security/authorization/).

When managing roles for Spinnaker, keep the following in mind:

* Roles are case insensitive. All roles are changed to lowercase in Fiat's internal model.
* You must explicitly configure permissions for each user role. The default for a user role is no permissions, which means it cannot perform any actions.


## Restrict application creation

To restrict which users can create applications in Spinnaker, perform the following steps:

1. Add the line `auth.permissions.provider.application: aggregate` to `SpinnakerService` manifest under key `spec.spinnakerConfig.profiles.fiat` if you are using Operator to deploy Spinnaker, or to `fiat-local.yml` if you are using Halyard.
2. Add prefixes as a source:

    ```yaml
    auth.permissions.source.application.prefix:
      enabled: true
    ```
3. Define the permissions for a prefix:

   ```yaml
   - prefix: <some_prefix>
     permissions:
      READ:
      - "<user role 1>"
      - "<user role 2>"
      - "<user role n>"
      WRITE:
      - "<user role n>"
      EXECUTE:
      - "user role n>"
   ```

   Here is an example configuration with in-line comments:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
   kind: SpinnakerService
   metadata:
     name: spinnaker
   spec:
     spinnakerConfig:  
       profiles:
         fiat: # Below section maps to fiat-local.yml if using Halyard
           # Enables Fiat to read from new sources.
           auth.permissions.provider.application: aggregate
           # Sets `prefix` as one of these new sources
           auth.permissions.source.application.prefix:
             enabled: true
             prefixes:
               # Defines the prefix `apptest-x`.
             - prefix: "apptest-*"
               permissions:
                 # Defines permission requirements for all applications that match the prefix `apptest-*` based on roles.
                 # role-one and role-two have READ permission
                 READ:
                 - "role-one"
                 - "role-two"
                 # role-one has write permission
                 WRITE:
                 - "role-one"
                 # role-one has execute permission
                 EXECUTE:
                 - "role-one"
   ```

    As a result, any application that matches the prefix `apptest-*` has restrictions on who can perform actions. For example, a user with the user role `role-two` only has `READ` permission.<br>

4. To restrict application creation specifically, add `fiat.restrictApplicationCreation` at the top of fiat config and set it to `true`.

    **Note: Currently, the prefix source is the only source that support the CREATE permission.**

   The following example builds upon the example from the previous steps. In-line comments describe additions:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/{{< param operator-extended-crd-version >}}
   kind: SpinnakerService
   metadata:
     name: spinnaker
   spec:
     spinnakerConfig:  
       profiles:
         fiat: # Below section maps to fiat-local.yml if using Halyard
           # Add CREATE as a permission
           fiat.restrictApplicationCreation: true
           auth.permissions.provider.application: aggregate
           auth.permissions.source.application.prefix:
             enabled: true
             prefixes:
             - prefix: "*"
               permissions:
                 # Assign CREATE permission to role-one
                 CREATE:
                 - "role-one"
                 READ:
                 - "role-one"
                 - "role-two"
                 WRITE:
                 - "role-one"
                 EXECUTE:
                 - "role-one"
   ```

   The above example assigns CREATE permission to users with the `role-one` role. Users without the `role-one` role cannot create any applications in Spinnaker.

5. Apply your configuration changes to Spinnaker by running the following command: `kubectl -n <spinnaker namespace> apply -f <SpinnakerService manifest>` if you are using Operator, or `hal deploy apply` if you are using Halyard.

The following screenshot shows what happens when a user without sufficient permissions attempts to create an application in Deck, Spinnaker's UI:
