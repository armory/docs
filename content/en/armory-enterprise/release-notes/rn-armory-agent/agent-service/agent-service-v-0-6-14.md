## Improvements

* The list of namespaces is now available sooner. Upon initial registration with the Agent, the list of namespaces of each account gets sent. Previously, they were received after the watching mechanism in Agent was finished. This change requires using the Agent Plugin version 0.10.17/0.9.33/0.8.41 or later.
