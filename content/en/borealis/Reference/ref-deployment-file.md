The deployment file is what you use to define how and where your app gets deployed to.

You can see what a blank deployment file looks like in the [Tempalte file](#template-file) section. To see a filled out example, see [Example file](#example-file).

## Blank template

You can see this template file by running the following command with the Borealis CLI:

```bash
armory template kubernetes canary
```

Or you can output the template to a file and modify it to suit your needs:

```bash
armory template kubernetes canary > deployment-template.yaml
```

<!-- 
## `application`

Provide a descriptive name for your application so that you can identify it when viewing the status of your deployment in the Status UI and other locations.

## `targets.`

This config block is where you define where and how you want to deploy an app.

### `targets.name`

The name of the environment you want to deploy to, such as `dev`.

#### `targets.name.account`

The account name that a target Kubernetes cluster got assigned when you installed the Remote Network Agent (RNA) on it. Specifically, it is the value for the `agent-k8s.accountName` parameter.

This name must match an existing cluster because Borealis uses the account name to determine which cluster to deploy to. 

#### `targets.name.namespace`

(Optional) The namespace on the target Kubernetes cluster that you want to deploy to. If you don't specify a namespace, Borealis will use the namespace defined in the manifest.

#### `targets.name.strategy`

This is the name of the strategy that you want to use to deploy your app. You define the strategy and its behavior in the `strategies` block.

## `manifests.`

### `manifests.path`

The path to a manifest file that you want to deploy or the directory where your manifests are stored. If you specify a directory, such as `/deployments/manifests/configmaps`, Borealis reads all the YAML files in the directory and deploys the manifests to the target you specified in `targets`.

## `strategies.`

This config block is where you define behavior and the actual steps to a deployment strategy.

### `strategies.<strategyName>`

The name you assign to the strategy. Use this name for `targets.name.strategy`.

### `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>`

What kind of deployment strategy this strategy uses. Borealis supports `canary`.

### `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps`

Borealis progresses through all the steps you define as part of the deployment process. The process is sequential and steps can either be of the type `setWeight` or `pause`.

Generally, you want to configure a `setWeight` step and have a `pause` step follow it although this is not necessarily required.

Here are two scenarios where this pairing sequence might not be used:

- You can start the sequence of steps with a `pause` that has no corresponding weight. That behaves as though the weight is `0` since it is as the start of the deployment. This results in the pause step happening before any of the app is deployed.
- You can follow a `setWeight` step with two `pause` steps. For example, after hitting the weight threshold, you could add a `pause` that waits for a certain amount of time and a pause that waits for a manual judgment.

You can add as many steps as you need but do not need to add a final step that deploys the app to 100% of the cluster. Borealis automatically does that after completing the final step you define.

### `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.setWeight.weight`

This is an integer value and determines how much of the cluster the app gets deployed to. The value must be between 0 and 100 and the the `weight` for each `setWeight` step should increase as the deployment progresses. After hitting this threshold, Borealis  pauses the deployment based on the behavior you set for `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause`.

### `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause`

There are two base behaviors you can set for `pause`, either a specific duration or until a manual judgment is made.



#### Pause for a set amount of time

If you want the deployment to pause for a certain amount of time after a weight is met, you must provide both the amount of time (duration) and the unit of time (unit).

`strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause.duration`

Integer value for the amount of time to pause.

`strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause.unit`

Unit of time for the pause:

- `seconds`
- `minutes`
- `hours`

#### Pause until a manual judgment

When you configure a manual judgment, the deployment waits when it hits the corresponding weight threshold. At that point, you can either approve the deployment so far and let it continue or roll the deployment back if something doesn't look right.

`strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause.untilApproved`

Set this to true.
