The deployment file is what you use to define how and where your app gets deployed to.

You can see what a blank deployment file looks like in the [Template file](#template-file) section. To see a filled out example, see [Example file](#example-file).

## Blank template

You can see this template file by running the following command with the Borealis CLI:

```bash
armory template kubernetes canary
```

Or you can output the template to a file and modify it to suit your needs:

```bash
armory template kubernetes canary > deployment-template.yaml
```

<details><summary>Show me the template</summary>

{{< include "aurora-borealis/borealis-yaml.md" >}}

</details>

## `application`

Provide a descriptive name for your application so that you can identify it when viewing the status of your deployment in the Status UI and other locations.

## `targets.`

This config block is where you define where and how you want to deploy an app. You can specify multiple targets. Provide unique descriptive names for each environment to which you are deploying.

```yaml
targets:
  <targetName>:
    account: <accountName>
    namespace: <namespaceOverride>
    strategy: <strategyName>
    constraints: <mapOfConstraints>
```



### `targets.<targetName>`

A descriptive name for this deployment, such as the name of the environment you want to deploy to. 

For example, this snippet configures a deployment target with the name `prod`:

```yaml
targets:
  prod:
...
```

### `targets.<targetName>.account`

The account name that a target Kubernetes cluster got assigned when you installed the Remote Network Agent (RNA) on it. Specifically, it is the value for the `agentIdentifier` parameter. Note that older versions of the RNA used the `agent-k8s.accountName` parameter.

This name must match an existing cluster because Borealis uses the identifier to determine which cluster to deploy to.

For example, this snippet configures a deployment to an environment named `prod` that is hosted on a cluster named `prod-cluster-west`:

```yaml
targets:
  prod:
    account: prod-cluster-west
...
```

### `targets.<targetName>.namespace`

(Recommended) The namespace on the target Kubernetes cluster that you want to deploy to. This field overrides any namespaces defined in your manifests.

For example, this snippet overrides the namespace in your manifest and deploys the app to a namespace called `overflow`:

```yaml
targets:
  prod:
    account: prod-cluster-west
    namespace: overflow
```

### `targets.<targetName>.strategy`

This is the name of the strategy that you want to use to deploy your app. You define the strategy and its behavior in the `strategies` block.

For example, this snippet configures a deployment to use the `canary-wait-til-approved` strategy:

```yaml
targets:
  prod:
    account: prod-cluster-west
    namespace: overflow
    strategy: canary-wait-til-approved
```

Read more about how this config is defined and used in the [strategies.<strategyName>](#strategies.<strategyName>) section.

### `targets.<targetName>.constraints`

A map of conditions that must be met before a deployment starts. The constraints can be dependencies on previous deployments, such as requiring deployments to a test environment before staging, or a pause. If you omit the constraints section, the deployment starts immediately when it gets triggered.

> Constraints are evaluated in parallel.

```yaml
targets:
  prod:
    account: prod-cluster-west
    namespace: overflow
    strategy: canary-wait-til-approved
    constraints:
      dependsOn: ["<targetName>"]
      beforeDeployment:
        - pause:
            untilApproved: true
        - pause: 
            duration: <integer>
            unit: <seconds|minutes|hours>
```

#### `targets.<targetName>.constraints.dependsOn`

A comma-separated list of deployments that must finish before this deployment can start. You can use this option to sequence deployments. Deployments with the same `dependsOn` criteria execute in parallel. For example, you can make it so that a deployment to prod cannot happen until a staging deployment finishes successfully.

The following example shows a deployment to `prod-west` that cannot start until the `dev-west` target finishes:

```yaml
targets:
  prod:
    account: prod-west
    namespace: overflow
    strategy: canary-wait-til-approved
    constraints:
      dependsOn: ["dev-west"]
```

#### `targets.<targetName>.constraints.beforeDeployment`

Conditions that must be met before the deployment can start. These are in addition to the deployments you define in `dependsOn` that must finish.

You can specify a pause that waits for a manual approval or a certain amount of time before starting.

Pause until manual approval

Use the following configs to configure this deployment to wait until a manual approval before starting:

- `targets.<targetName>.constraints.beforeDeployment.pause.untilApproved` set to true

```yaml
targets:
  prod:
    account: prod-cluster-west
    namespace: overflow
    strategy: canary-wait-til-approved
    constraints:
      dependsOn: ["dev-west"]
      beforeDeployment:
        - pause:
            untilApproved: true
```

Pause for a certain amount of time

- `targets.<targetName>.constraints.beforeDeployment.pause.duration` set to an integer value for the amount of time to wait before starting after the `dependsOn` condition is met. 
- `targets.<targetName>.constraints.beforeDeployment.pause.unit` set to `seconds`, `minutes` or `hours` to indicate the unit of time to wait.

```yaml
targets:
  prod:
    account: prod-cluster-west
    namespace: overflow
    strategy: canary-wait-til-approved
    constraints:
      dependsOn: ["dev-west"]
      beforeDeployment:
        - pause:
            duration: 60
            unit: seconds
```

## `manifests.`

```yaml
manifests:
  # Directory containing manifests
  - path: /path/to/manifest/directory
    targets: ["<targetName1>", "<targetName2>"]
  # Specific manifest file
  - path: /path/to/specific/manifest.yaml
    targets: ["<targetName3>", "<targetName4>"]
```  

### `manifests.path`

The path to a manifest file that you want to deploy or the directory where your manifests are stored. If you specify a directory, such as `/deployments/manifests/configmaps`, Borealis reads all the YAML files in the directory and deploys the manifests to the target you specified in `targets`.

### `manifests.path.targets`

(Optional). If you omit this option, the manifests are deployed to all targets listed in the deployment file. A comma-separated list of deployment targets that you want to deploy the manifests to. Make sure to enclose each target in quotes. Use the name you defined in `targets.<targetName>` to refer to a deployment target. 

## `strategies.`

This config block is where you define behavior and the actual steps to a deployment strategy.

```yaml
strategies:
  <strategyName>
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight:
            weight: <integer>
        - pause:
            duration: <integer>
            unit: <seconds|minutes|hours>
        - setWeight:
            weight: <integer>
        - pause:
            untilApproved: true
```

### `strategies.<strategyName>`

The name you assign to the strategy. Use this name for `targets.<targetName>.strategy`. You can define multiple strategies, so make sure to use a unique descriptive name for each.

For example, this snippet names the strategy `canary-wait-til-approved`:

```yaml
strategies:
  canary-wait-til-approved:
```

You would use `canary-wait-til-approved` as the value for `targets.<targetName>.strategy` that is at the start of the file:

```yaml
...
targets:
  someName:
    ...
    strategy: canary-wait-till-approved
...
```

### `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>`

The kind of deployment strategy this strategy uses. Borealis supports `canary`.

```yaml
strategies:
  <strategyName>
    canary:
```

### `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps`

Borealis progresses through all the steps you define as part of the deployment process. The process is sequential and steps can either be of the type `setWeight` or `pause`.

Generally, you want to configure a `setWeight` step and have a `pause` step follow it although this is not necessarily required.

Some scenarios where this pairing sequence might not be used would be the following:

- You can start the sequence of steps with a `pause` that has no corresponding weight. Borealis recognizes this as a weight of `0` since it is as the start of the deployment. This causes the deployment to pause at the start before any of the app is deployed.
- You want to have two `pause` steps in a row, such as a `pause` for a set amount of time followed by a `pause` for a manual judgment.

You can add as many steps as you need but do not need to add a final step that deploys the app to 100% of the cluster. Borealis automatically does that after completing the final step you define.

### `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.setWeight.weight`

This is an integer value and determines how much of the cluster the app gets deployed to. The value must be between 0 and 100 and the the `weight` for each `setWeight` step should increase as the deployment progresses. After hitting this threshold, Borealis pauses the deployment based on the behavior you set for  the `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause` that follows.


For example, this snippet instructs Borealis to deploy the app to 33% of the cluster:

```yaml
...
steps:
  - setWeight:
      weight: 33
```

### `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause`

There are two base behaviors you can set for `pause`, either a set amount of time or until a manual judgment is made.

```yaml
steps:
...
  - pause: 
      duration: <integer>
      unit: <seconds|minutes|hours>
...
  - pause:
      untilApproved: true 
```

### Pause for a set amount of time

If you want the deployment to pause for a certain amount of time after a weight is met, you must provide both the amount of time (duration) and the unit of time (unit).

- `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause.duration`
  - Use an integer value for the amount of time. 
- `strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause.unit`
  - Use `seconds`, `minutes` or `hours` for unit of time.

For example, this snippet instructs Borealis to wait for 30 seconds:

```yaml
steps:
...
  - pause: 
      duration: 30
      unit: seconds
```

### Pause until a manual judgment

When you configure a manual judgment, the deployment waits when it hits the corresponding weight threshold. At that point, you can either approve the deployment so far and let it continue or roll the deployment back if something doesn't look right.

`strategies.<strategyName>.<strategy>.steps.pause.untilApproved: true`

For example: 

```yaml
steps:
...
  - pause:
      untilApproved: true 
```
