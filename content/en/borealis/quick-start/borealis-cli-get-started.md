## {{% heading "prereq" %}}

Before you start, make sure that someone at your organization has completed the [Get Started with Project Borealis]({{< ref "borealis-org-get-started" >}}). That guide describes how to prepare your deployment target so that you can use the Borealis CLI to deploy apps to it.

## Register for Armory's hosted cloud services

Register for Armory's hosted cloud services by accepting the invitation. You should receive an email invite to Borealis from your organization's administrator.

Note that you need a device that can support OTP two-factor authentication, such as a smartphone with the Google Authenticator app.

## Install the Borealis CLI

The CLI binary is called `armory`. You can install the CLI using the Armory Version Manager (AVM) or you can install the `armory` binary manually.

Armory recommends installing the AVM because you can use it to quickly and easily download, install, and update the CLI. The AVM provides additional features such as the ability to list installed CLI versions and to declare which version of the CLI to use.

If you choose to install the CLI binary manually, you must download a specific release binary from GitHub and install that release. You have to repeat the installation process each time you upgrade the CLI version.

{{% tabbody name="Automated (Recommended)" %}}

1. Download the AVM for your operating system and CPU architecture. You can manually download it from the [repo](https://github.com/armory/avm/releases/) or use the following command:

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/armory/avm/releases/latest/download/avm-<os>-<architecture>
   ```

   For example, the following command downloads the latest version for macOS (Darwin):

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/armory/avm/releases/latest/download/avm-darwin-amd64
   ```

   You can see the full list of available releases in the [repo](https://github.com/armory/avm/releases/).
2. Give AVM execute permissions. For example (on macOS):

   ```bash
   chmod +x avm-darwin-amd64
   ```

4. Confirm that `/usr/local`/bin is on your `PATH`:

   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```
   The command returns your `PATH`, which should now include `/usr/local/bin/`.

5. Rename the AVM binary to `avm` and move it to `/usr/local/bin`, which is on your `PATH`. For example (on macOS):

   ```bash
   mv avm-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/avm
   ```

6. Run the following command to install the Borealis CLI:

   ```bash
   avm install
   ```

   The command installs the Borealis CLI and returns a directory that you need to add to your path, such as `/Users/milton/.avm/bin`.

   If you get an `developer  cannot be identified error` when trying to run AVM, you must allow AVM to run.

   <details><summary>Show me how to allow AVM to run.</summary>

   On macOS, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General** and click **Allow Anyway**.

   For more information, see the macOS documentation about [how to open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).

   </details></br>

7. Add the directory that AVM returned when you ran `avm install` to your path.

   <details><summary>Show me how to add the directory.</summary>

   You can either add the path directly to `/etc/paths` or add it to your shell profile. The following steps describe how to add it to your shell profile:
   1. Edit the resource file for your shell, such as `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or .`zshrc`. For example:

      ```bash
      vi ~/.bashrc
      ```

    1. In the file, find the line for the `PATH` that your resource file exports. They follow the format `export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH`.
    2. Insert the path provided by AVM (such as `/Users/brianle/.avm/bin`) before the ending `$PATH`. The line should look similar to this:

       ```bash
       export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin::/Users/milton/.avm/bin:$PATH
       ```

    3. Save the file.
    4. Reload your terminal, open a new session, or `source` your terminal profile file (for example, `source .bash_profile`).

   </details></br>

8. Run the following command to verify that the Borealis CLI is installed:

   ```bash
   armory
   ```

   The command returns basic information about the  Borealis CLI, including available commands.

For the AVM or the CLI, you can use the `-h` flag for more information about specific commands.

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/armory/armory-cli/releases) for your operating system.
1. Save the file in a directory that is on your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.
1. Rename the downloaded file to `armory`.
1. Give the file execute permission:

   ```bash
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/armory
   ```

1. Verify that you can run the Borealis CLI:

   ```bash
   armory
   ```

## Manually deploy apps using the CLI

>Project Borealis manages your Kubernetes deployments using ReplicaSet resources. During the initial deployment of your application using Project Borealis, the underlying Kubernetes deployment object is deleted in a way that it leaves behind the ReplicaSet and pods so that there is no actual downtime for your application. These are later deleted when the deployment succeeds.

Before you can deploy, make sure that you have the Client ID and Client Secret for your deployment target available. These are used to authenticate Armory's hosted deployment services with the target cluster. The credentials were created and tied to your deployment target as part of the [Get Started with Project Borealis]({{< ref "borealis-org-get-started" >}}) guide.

Since you are using the Borealis CLI, you do not need to have service account credentials for authenticating your CLI to the deployment services. Instead, you log in manually with your user account.

**If this is the first deployment of your app, Borealis automatically deploys the app to 100% of the cluster since there is no previous version.** Subsequent deployments of this app follow the steps defined in your deployment file.

1. Log in to Armory's hosted deployment services from the CLI.

   ```bash
   armory login
   ```

   The CLI returns a `Device Code` and opens your default browser. To complete the log in process, confirm the code in your browser.

   After you successfully authenticate, the CLI returns a list of environments.

1. Select the environment you want to log in to.   
1. Generate your deployment template and output it to a file.

   This command generates a deployment template for canary deployments and saves it to a file named `canary.yaml`:

   ```bash
   armory template kubernetes canary > canary.yaml
   ```

   <details><summary>Show me an empty template</summary>
   {{< include "aurora-borealis/dep-file/borealis-yaml-basic.md" >}}
   </details><br>

1. Customize your deployment file by setting the following minimum set of parameters:

   - `application`: The name of your app.
   - `targets.<deploymentName>`: A descriptive name for your deployment. Armory recommends using the environment name.
   - `targets.<deploymentName>.account`: The name of the deployment target cluster. This is the name that was assigned to the cluster using the `agentIdentifier` parameter when you installed the RNA. Note that older versions of the RNA used the `agent-k8s.accountName` parameter.
   - `targets.<deploymentName>.strategy`: the name of the deployment strategy you want to use. You define the strategy in `strategies.<strategy-name>`.
   - `manifests`: a map of manifest locations. This can be a directory of `yaml (yml)` files or a specific manifest. Each entry must use the following convention:  `- path: /path/to/directory-or-file`
   - `strategies.<strategy-name>`: the list of your deployment strategies. Use one of these for `targets.<target-cluster>.strategy`. Each strategy in this section consists of a map of steps for your deployment strategy in the following format:

     ```yaml
     strategies:
       my-demo-strat: # Name that you use for `targets.<deploymentName>.strategy
       - canary # The type of deployment strategy to use. Borealis supports `canary`.
          steps:
            - setWeight:
                weight: <integer> # What percentage of the cluster to roll out the manifest to before pausing.
            - pause:
                duration: <integer> # How long to pause before deploying the manifest to the next threshold.
                unit: <seconds|minutes|hours> # The unit of time for the duration.
            - setWeight:
                weight: <integer> # The next percentage threshold the manifest should get deployed to before pausing.
            - pause:
                untilApproved: true # Wait until a user provides a manual approval before deploying the manifest
     ```

   Each step can have the same or different pause behaviors. Additionally, you can configure as many steps  as you want for the deployment strategy, but you do not need to create a step with a weight set to 100. Once Borealis completes the last step you configure, the manifest gets deployed to the whole cluster automatically.

   {{< include "aurora-borealis/dep-file/borealis-yaml-example-basic.md" >}}

    </details><br>

1. (Optional) Ensure there are no YAML issues with your deployment file.

   Since a hidden tab in your YAML can cause your deployment to fail, it's a good idea to validate the struture and syntax in your deployment file. There are several online linters, IDE-based linters, and command line linters such as `yamllint` that you can use to validate your deployment file.

1. Start the deployment.

   ```bash
   armory deploy start  -f canary.yaml
   ```

   The command starts your deployment and progresses until the first weight and pause you set. It also returns a deployment ID that you can use to check the status of your deployment and a link to the Status UI page for your deployment.


## Monitor your deployment

You can monitor the progress of any deployment through the Borealis CLI itself or from the Status UI. The Status UI gives you a visual representation of a deployment's health and progress in addition to controls. If your deployment strategy includes a manual approval step, use the Status UI to approve the step and continue.

Run the following command to monitor your deployment through the Borealis CLI:

```bash
armory deploy status -i <deployment-ID>
```

### Initial deployment failure

If the initial deployment of your app using Project Borealis fails or is manually rolled back, the ReplicaSet is orphaned rather than deleted. In this situation, you should manually delete the orphaned ReplicaSet _only after the initial deployment runs successfully_.

To delete the orphaned ReplicaSet:
1. Get a list of ReplicaSet objects

   ```bash
   kubectl get rs -n <namespace>
   ```

1. Identify the ReplicaSet with the old version of your application. This is typically the ReplicaSet with the greater age.
1. Delete the orphaned ReplicaSet:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete rs <ReplicaSet_name> -n <namespace>
   ```


## Advanced use cases

You can integrate Borealis with your existing tools, such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions, to automate your deployment process with Borealis. To get started, create [service accounts]({{< ref "borealis-automate" >}}).

## Upgrade the CLI

Run the following command to upgrade your existing CLI:

```bash
avm install
```

## Troubleshooting

### Developer cannot be verified error when trying to run AVM

Depending on your operating system settings, you may need to allow apps from an unidentified developer in order to use AVM. For macOS, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General** and click **Allow Anyway**. For more information, see the macOS documentation about [how to open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).

### Bad CPU type

`bad CPU type in executable`

This issue occurs if the AVM version you downloaded does not match your CPU architecture. For example, if you try to run an `arm64` build on a system that is not ARM based. Verify that you downloaded the correct AVM version for your system.

### Error writing credentials file

`error: Error: there was an error writing the credentials file. `

This issue occurs because the the directory where the Borealis CLI stores your credentials after you run `armory login` does not exist. You can create the directory by running the following command:

```bash
mkdir ~/.armory/credentials
```

Make sure you are running the lastest version of the CLI.
