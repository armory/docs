To use Project Aurora/Borealis, make sure you meet the following requirements.

## Armory Remote Network Agent

Project Aurora/Borealis uses agents that run in target Kubernetes clusters to communicate with Armory hosted cloud services, specifically the Agent Hub. Make sure your environment meets the [networking](#networking) requirements so that the agents can communicate with the Agent Hub. 

There are no additional requirements for installing the agents that Project Aurora/Borealis use. For information about how to install these agents, see [Enable Project Aurora in target Kubernetes clusters]({{< ref "aurora-install#enable-aurora-in-target-kubernetes-clusters" >}}) or [Get Started with Project Borealis]({{< ref "borealis-org-get-started" >}}).

> If you are using the Armory Agent for Kubernetes, that is a separate agent from the Remote Networking Agent. It has its own requirements. For more information, see [those requirements]({{< ref "armory-agent-quick#before-you-begin" >}}).

## Argo Rollouts

Project Aurora requires Argo Rollouts 1.x or later installed in the Kubernetes cluster you want to deploy to. Note that the Argo Rollout Controller is separate from Argo CD.

If you use the Helm chart described in [Enable Project Aurora in target Kubernetes clusters]({{< ref "aurora-install#enable-aurora-in-target-kubernetes-clusters" >}}), Argo Rollouts is installed as part of that Helm chart.

If your target deployment cluster already has Argo Rollouts installed, you can turn off that part of the Helm chart.

## Deployment target

You need a Kubernetes cluster to act as the deployment target for your app. The cluster must run Kubernetes 1.16 or later.

## Networking

> Note that the Spinnaker requirements are applicable only if you use the Project Aurora stage for Armory Enterprise (or Spinnaker).
