## Armory CD-as-a-Service Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Armory CD-as-a-Service uses OIDC to authenticate both user and machine principals and issue short-lived access tokens, which are signed JSON web tokens (JWTs).

The Armory CD-as-a-Service API consumes these access tokens in order to validate that a request has authorization for a given tenantâ€™s resources and operations.

Use the the [CD-as-a-Service Console](https://console.cloud.armory.io/) to manage the following:

- Create credentials for machines and scope them for specific permissions and use cases.
- Invite and manage users.
- Enable OIDC based external identity providers (IdP), such as Okta, Auth0, or OneLogin.
