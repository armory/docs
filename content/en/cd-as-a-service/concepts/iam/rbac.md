You are familiar with the concepts discussed in  {{< linkWithTitle "cd-as-a-service/concepts/architecture/orgs-tenants.md" >}}.

## Overview of RBAC in CD-as-a-Service

CD-as-a-Service's RBAC implementation provides you with the following features:

* [System-defined roles](#system-roles) for admins and machine-to-machine credentials
* [Custom roles](#custom-role-examples) that you create to fit your company's needs
* [SSO groups to custom RBAC roles mapping](#sso-groups-and-rbac-roles)
* [Role-based deployment approval]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/concepts/deployment/role-based-manual-approval.md" >}})

## RBAC implementation

    class Role {

    }
    class Grant {
      +GrantType type
      +String resource
      +List~Permission~ permissions
    }
    class GrantType {      
      api
    }
    class Permission {

    }
    class User {
      +List~Role~ roles
    }
    class M2MCredential {
      +List~Role~ roles
    }
    class Tenant {
      +String name
    }

    Role "1" --> "*" Grant
    Grant "1" --> "*" Permission
    Grant "1" --> "1" GrantType
    Role "1" --> "1" Tenant
    Role "1" --> "1" Tenant
    User "1" --> "*" Role
    M2MCredential "1" --> "*" Role
```


Central to CD-as-a-Service's [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) implementation is a _Role_, which defines what a user can do within the platform. Each Role has a _Grants_ collection that defines permissions.

You define your custom RBAC roles in a YAML file that has this structure:

{{< prism lang="yaml" line-numbers="true" >}}
roles:
  - name: <role-name>
    tenant: <tenant-name>
    grants:
      - type: <type>
        resource: <resource>
        permission: <permission>
{{< /prism >}}

You can create an organization-wide role by omitting the `tenant` definition.

### Grants

A _Grant_ has type, resource, and permission attributes.

`type` has a single choice: `api`.

`resource` defines what area the Grant can access. It has the following values:

* `tenant`: When you use `tenant` as the `resource`, the Grant allows access to the tenant that you specify in the `roles.tenant` field. You use `tenant` when you define a [Tenant Admin role](#tenant-admin-role).
* `deployment`: This resource allows the role to deploy using the CLI and manage deployments in the **Deployments** UI. If you omit `roles.tenant`, the role has this Grant across your organization.
* `organization`: You use this resource when you need to create an Organization Admin role that maps to an SSO group. See [SSO groups and RBAC roles](#sso-groups-and-rbac-roles) for more on mapping SSO groups to RBAC roles.

`permission` has one option: `full`.

### System roles

CD-as-a-Service provides the following system roles:

* Organization Admin
  * Grants:  

      * UI - full access to all screens and functionality
      * CLI -  full authority to execute all CLI commands

  * Assignment:  

      * CD-as-a-Service assigns this role to the person who creates a new CD-as-a-Service account (Organization).
      * You are able to manually assign the Organization Admin role to all users you invite to your Organization, thus bypassing the need to create custom RBAC roles.

* Deployments Full Access

  * Grants:
      * This role grants full authority to trigger deployments.
  * Assignment:
      * Assign this role to Client Credentials that you plan to use with CI tools like GitHub Actions.

* Remote Network Agent

  * Grants:
      * This role grants a Remote Network Agent access to CD--as-a-Service.
  * Assignment:
      * Assign this role to all Client Credentials you create to use with Remote Network Agents.


## Custom role examples

### Tenant Admin role

This example defines three Tenant Admin roles, one for each tenant. Each role has full authority within the specified tenant.

{{< prism lang="yaml" line-numbers="true" >}}
roles:
  - name: Tenant Admin Main
    tenant: main
    grants:
      - type: api
        resource: tenant
        permission: full
  - name: Tenant Admin Finance
    tenant: finance
    grants:
      - type: api
        resource: tenant
        permission: full
  - name: Tenant Admin Commerce
    tenant: commerce
    grants:
      - type: api
        resource: tenant
        permission: full
{{< /prism >}}

If you want to grant a user permission to manage all of your tenants, assign that user the **Organization Admin** role using the UI.

### Deployment roles

This example defines a role that grants permission to use the **Deployments** UI and start deployments using the CLI. The role is bound to the `finance` tenant.

{{< prism lang="yaml" line-numbers="true" >}}
roles:
  - name: Deployer Finance
    tenant: finance
    grants:
      - type: api
        resource: deployment
        permission: full
{{< /prism >}}

This next example defines a role that grants permission to use the **Deployments** UI and start deployments using the CLI across your entire organization. Note that `tenant` is not defined, which makes this an organization-wide role.

{{< prism lang="yaml" line-numbers="true" >}}
roles:
  - name: Deployer All Tenants
    grants:
      - type: api
        resource: deployment
        permission: full
{{< /prism >}}


## Assign roles

After you define your roles, you use the CLI to [add your roles]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/tasks/iam/create-role" >}}) to your CD-as-a-Service Organization. You do all subsequent role management with the CLI, but you [assign roles to users]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/tasks/iam/manage-role-user" >}}) using the UI.

All users must have at least one role in order to use CD-as-a-Service. You can assign the Organization Admin role or a custom role. If a user has login credentials but no role assigned, the user sees a blank **Deployments** screen after logging in.

A Client Credential must also have an RBAC role to access CD-as-a-Service functionality. See {{< linkWithTitle "cd-as-a-service/tasks/iam/client-creds.md" >}} for how to assign a role to a Client Credential.

## SSO groups and RBAC roles

>There is no self-service function for integrating your SSO provider. Contact your Armory rep if you want to use SSO with CD-as-a-Service.

You must create your RBAC roles using the same names as your SSO groups. For example, your company has the following groups defined in its SSO provider:

1. Engineering-Lead
1. Engineering-Deployment
1. Engineering-Infra

You want to use those groups in CD-as-a-Service, so you need to create roles for those SSO groups. In the following example, `Engineering-Lead` has a tenant-specific Tenant Admin role, `Engineering-Deployment` has a tenant-specific deployment role, and `Engineering-Infra` has the equivalent of an Organization Admin role.

{{< prism lang="yaml" line-numbers="true" line="" >}}
roles:
  - name: Engineering-Lead
    tenant: main
    grants:
      - type: api
        resource: tenant
        permission: full
  - name: Engineering-Deployment
    tenant: main
    grants:
      - type: api
        resource: deployment
        permission: full
  - name: Engineering-Infra
    grants:
      - type: api
        resource: organization
        permission: full
{{< /prism >}}

During authentication, CD-as-a-Service maps a user's SSO groups to your defined RBAC roles.

{{% alert title="Caution" color="warning" %}}
1. The SSO role does not appear in the UI. You cannot use CD-as-a-Service to assign an SSO role to a user.
1. You cannot use CD-as-a-Service to inspect the SSO groups that a user belongs to.
