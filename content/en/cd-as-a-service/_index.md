{{< youtube-enhanced id="r29UCKMXEi4" title="CD-as-a-Service Simplifies Your Deployment Process" widthPercent="75" heightPercent="85" >}}

Armory CD-as-a-Service delivers intelligent deployment-as-a-service that supports advanced deployment strategies so developers can focus on building
great code rather than deploying it. By automating code deployment across all of your Kubernetes environments, Armory CD-as-a-Service removes demands on developers and reduces the risk of service disruptions due to change failures. It does this by seamlessly integrating pre-production verification tasks with advanced production deployment strategies. This mitigates risks by providing deployment flexibility while limiting blast radius, which leads to a better customer experience. Best of all, Armory CD-as-a-Service doesnâ€™t require migrating to a new deployment platform. It easily plugs into any existing SDLC.
