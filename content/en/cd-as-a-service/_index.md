## Overview of Armory CD-as-a-Service

{{< youtube-enhanced id="r29UCKMXEi4" title="CD-as-a-Service Simplifies Your Deployment Process" widthPercent="75" heightPercent="85" >}}

Armory CD-as-a-Service delivers intelligent deployment-as-a-service that supports advanced deployment strategies so developers can focus on building
great code rather than deploying it. By automating code deployment across all of your Kubernetes environments, Armory CD-as-a-Service removes demands on developers and reduces the risk of service disruptions due to change failures. It does this by seamlessly integrating pre-production verification tasks with advanced production deployment strategies. This mitigates risks by providing deployment flexibility while limiting blast radius, which leads to a better customer experience. Best of all, Armory CD-as-a-Service doesnâ€™t require migrating to a new deployment platform. It easily plugs into any existing SDLC.

## Docs organization

If you're familiar with the Kubernetes docs, you may notice that the CD-as-a-Service docs are organized in a similar fashion:

* [Get Started]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/setup" >}}): This section contains guides to quickly get you started using core CD-as-a-Service functionality.
* [Concepts]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/concepts" >}}): These pages explain aspects of CD-as-a-Service. The content is objective, containing architecture, definitions, rules, and guidelines. Rather than containing a sequence of steps, these pages link to related tasks and tutorials.
* [Guides]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/tasks" >}}): Pages in the this section show you how to perform discreet tasks (single procedures) by following a short series of steps that produce an intended outcome. Task content expects a minimum level of background knowledge, and each page links to conceptual content that you should be familiar with before you begin the task.
* [Tutorials]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/tutorials" >}}): A tutorial is an end-to-end example of how to do accomplish a goal and is comprised of several tasks performed in sequence. For example, a tutorial might show you how to deploy an demo app by cloning a repo, logging in using the CLI, creating a deployment file, and finally deploying the app. Like a task, a tutorial should link to content you should know and items you should complete before starting the tutorial.
* [Reference]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/reference" >}}): This section contains both manually maintained and autogenerated reference material such as a breakdown of the deployment file, canary analysis queries, and CLI command options.
* [Release Notes]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/release-notes" >}})
