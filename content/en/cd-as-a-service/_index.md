## Overview of Armory CD-as-a-Service

Armory CD-as-a-Service delivers intelligent deployment-as-a-service that supports advanced deployment strategies so developers can focus on building
great code rather than deploying it. By automating code deployment across all of your Kubernetes environments, Armory CD-as-a-Service removes demands on developers and reduces the risk of service disruptions due to change failures. It does this by seamlessly integrating preproduction verification tasks with advanced production deployment strategies. This mitigates risks by providing deployment flexibility while limiting blast radius, which leads to a better customer experience. Best of all, Armory CD-as-a-Service doesnâ€™t require migrating to a new deployment platform. It easily plugs into any existing SDLC.

## Start using Armory CD-as-a-Service

The **Get Started** section contains guides that walk you through the core functionality. The {{< linkWithTitle "cd-as-a-service/setup/get-started.md" >}} guide shows you how to sign up for an account and then connect to your Kubernetes cluster. You can complete the process in under 5 minutes.

Read the {{< linkWithTitle "cd-as-a-service/setup/cli.md" >}} guide to learn how to install the CLI, create a deployment file, and deploy your app.

After you've completed those guides, you can follow the {{< linkWithTitle "cd-as-a-service/tutorials/deploy-demo-app.md" >}}, in which you fork a demo app repo and deploy that app to your Kubernetes cluster.

In addition to deployment using the CLI, you can start a deployment from your GitHub workflow. Read the {{< linkWithTitle "cd-as-a-service/setup/gh-action.md" >}} guide to integrate Armory CD-as-a-Service's GitHub Action into your workflow.
