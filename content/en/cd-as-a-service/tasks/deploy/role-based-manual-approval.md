* You have read {{< linkWithTitle "cd-as-a-service/concepts/deployment/role-based-manual-approval.md" >}} to learn how role-based manual approvals can enforce your SDLC's approval processes in Armory CD-as-a-Service.


## Configure role-based manual approval

In your deployment manifest, add a `requiresRole` field to your manual approval.

{{< prism lang="yaml" line-numbers="true" line="" >}}
...
pause:
  untilApproved: true
  requiresRoles: []
...
{{< /prism >}}

- `requiresRoles`: list of RBAC roles

For example, if you want only users with an "Approver", "InfoSec", or "Release Manager" role to be able to issue a manual approval, you would add those roles to the `requiresRole` list:

{{< prism lang="yaml" line-numbers="true" line="" >}}
...
pause:
  untilApproved: true
  requiresRoles: ["Approver", "InfoSec", "Release Manager"]
...
{{< /prism >}}
