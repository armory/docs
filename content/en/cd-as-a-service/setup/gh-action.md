## {{% heading "prereq" %}}

If you have previously configured Armory CD-as-a-Service for your deployment target, you can skip to step 3.

1. Review the full set of requirements for Armory CD-as-a-Service at [System Requirements]({{< ref "requirements" >}}).
2. If you have already prepared a deployment target for Armory CD-as-a-Service, skip this step. If you have not, complete the {{< linkWithTitle "get-started.md" >}} tasks, which include the following:

   - [Register for Armory CD-as-a-Service]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/setup/get-started" >}}).
   - [Create machine-to-machine client credentials]({{< ref "client-creds" >}}) for the Remote Network Agent (RNA), which you install on your deployment target cluster.
   - Add a Kubernetes Cluster by installing the RNA.

3. [Create a credential]({{< ref "cd-as-a-service/tasks/iam/client-creds" >}}) for your GitHub Action to use to connect to CD-as-a-Service. Assign the `Deployments Full Access` role to your credential.

4. Encrypt the GitHub Action service account credentials so that you can use them securely in the action. Create a secret for the Client ID and a separate secret for the Client Secret.

   Use descriptive name for these two values. You use the name to reference them in the GitHub Action.

   For more information, see GitHub's [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) guide.

## Configure the GitHub Action

Configuring the GitHub Action is a multi-part process:

1. [Get your manifest path](#get-your-manifest-path)
1. [Create a deployment file](#create-a-deployment-file)
1. [Configure the action](#configure-the-action)

### Get your manifest path

You need the path to the manifests you want to deploy when you create a deployment file. The value is used for the `path` parameter in the `manifests` block.

Note that the path you provide for the `manifests` block is relative to where the GitHub Action YAML is stored (`.github/workflows`). For example, if your repo looks like this:

```
.github/workflows
deployments
--manifests
----sample-app.yaml
```

Then, the value you use for `path` in the deployment file should be `/deployments/manifests/sample-app.yaml`.

### Create a deployment file

The [deployment file]({{< ref "ref-deployment-file" >}}) is a YAML file that defines what app you want to deploy and how Armory CD-as-a-Service should deploy it. You can use the [CLI]({{< ref "cli#manually-deploy-apps-using-the-cli" >}}) to generate a deployment file template.

Save your deployment file to a directory in your repo. You use this path later when you create the GitHub Action for the `path-to-file` parameter.

### Configure the action

> If you are new to using GitHub Actions, see [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) guide for information about setting up GitHub Actions.

Before you start, you need the path to the deployment file you created earlier. This value is used for the `path-to-file` parameter.

Note that the path you provide for the `path-to-file` parameter is relative to where your GitHub Action YAML is stored (`.github/workflows`). For example, if your repo looks like this:

```
.github/workflows
deployments
--deployment.yaml
```
Then `path-to-file` should be `/deployments/deployment.yaml`.

Save the following YAML file to your `.github/workflows` directory:

```yaml
name: <Descriptive Name>

on:
  push: # What triggers a deployment. For example, `push`.
    branches:
      - <branchName> # What branch triggers a deployment. For example, `main`.

jobs:
  build:
    name: <Descriptive Name> # This name appears on the Actions tab in the GitHub UI.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deployment
        uses: armory/cli-deploy-action@main
        with:
          clientId: "${{ secrets.<CLIENTID> }}" # Encrypted Client ID that you created in the CD-as-a-Service Console that has been encrypted with GitHub's encrypted secrets. Replace <CLIENTD> with the name you gave your encrypted secret.
          clientSecret:  "${{ secrets.<CLIENTSECRET> }}" # Client Secret that you created in the CD-as-a-Service Console that has been encrypted with GitHub's encrypted secrets. Replace <CLIENTSECRET> with the name you gave your encrypted secret.
          path-to-file: "/path/to/deployment.yaml" # Path to the deployment file.
```

## Deploy

Now you can trigger a deployment based on what you defined in the action workflow, such as a `push` to the `main` branch.

When the action runs, Armory CD-as-a-Service starts your deployment, and it progresses to the first weight you set. After completing the first step, what Armory CD-as-a-Service does next depends on the steps you defined in your deployment file. Armory CD-as-a-Service either waits a set amount of time or until you provide a manual approval.

You can monitor the progress by using the Deployments UI. The GitHub Action provides both the deployment ID and a URL to the Deployments UI page for the deployment.

To see the deployment ID and the Deployments UI link, perform the following steps:

1. In your repo, go to the **Actions** tab.
2. Select the workflow run that corresponds to the deployment.
3. Select the GitHub Action. This is the `name` parameter you used in the `jobs` block.
4. In the **Deployment** section, you can find the **Deployment ID** and a link to the **deployment status UI**.
